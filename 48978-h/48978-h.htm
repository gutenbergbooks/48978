<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> know our girls. We know and sympathize with their
restless longing for activity. The normal girl simply must be
doing something, and this ceaseless energy, at times rather appalling
to her elders, is but natural and right. It is in the young
blood coursing so swiftly and joyously through her veins, and
it must find vent in one way or another. But there is no need
of doing that which brings neither true pleasure nor the joy
of accomplishing something worth while, for the world is full of
delightful things really worth the doing. We have only to open
our eyes and ears to find them crowding forward to claim our
attention, and the choice is between better and best.</p>

<p>There are merry frolics and active games that stimulate the
health and renew the vitality of the body and there are scores of
charming things for willing hands to make which are not only
worth the making but which bring skill to the fingers and
breadth and energy to the mind.</p>

<p>In this, our fourth book for girls, we are giving some of the
things we have found well worth the doing, and it is our hope
that our girl friends will also see their worth and find in them
inspiration for further experiments in pastime and frolics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>A FOURTH OF JULY
LAWN FROLIC</small><br /><br /></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_019-drop_t.jpg" width="100" height="125" alt="T" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">THIS is not to be a formal lawn
party, but a genuine, fun-provoking
Fourth of July frolic
with every one in comfortable
dress appropriate for active
games. There is to be no dancing,
no tennis, nothing in the
way of ordinary entertainment
except, perhaps, the refreshments,
and they too should be
as nearly in keeping with the
day as possible.</div>

<p>Prepare your guests for something
novel by issuing your invitations in the form of giant firecrackers.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Decorate Your Grounds</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and make them as festive as possible with fluttering flags, floating
streamers, red, white, and blue bunting, and Japanese lanterns.
Also provide a number of small flags, one for each guest, to be
worn in the hat, hair, belt, and buttonhole. This little touch of
uniform will not only make the scene gayer and more exhilarating,
but, like badges of an order, will have the effect of dispelling
the stiffness of new acquaintances, and bringing the party closer
together as members of one band of merrymakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>For the Giant Firecracker Invitations</b></p>

<p class="unindent">you will need several sheets of bright red tissue paper, more of
white tissue paper, and some white unlined writing paper. A
ball of soft white cotton string will also be required.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;"><a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i_020a.jpg" width="405" height="93" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.—Lay the paper cylinder on the red tissue paper..</div>
</div>

<p>Cut an oblong of red tissue paper, a circular piece of white tissue
paper, and a square of writing paper for each invitation. Make
the red oblong six inches long and three inches wide, the circle six
inches in diameter, and the writing paper four inches square. Of
the paper square make a cylindrical roll that will measure about
three-quarters of an inch across the end. The easiest way to do
this is to roll the paper on a candle, keeping the end edges even,
and paste the side edge down while still wrapped around the candle.
Pull the candle out of the paper and you have a perfect cylinder.
Place the paper cylinder on the red tissue paper oblong so that
there will be an even inch of red paper at each end (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). Paste
one long edge of the red paper to the cylinder and roll it on the
table, bringing the opposite
edge up smoothly,
then paste that edge also
in place (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;"><a id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/i_020b.jpg" width="324" height="160" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.—Cylinder in red paper cover.</div>
</div>

<p>Now prepare and
write the note of invitation
to be put in the
firecracker envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>With Short Brush Strokes,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">from inside to edge, paint an irregular band of blue, half an inch
wide, around the edge of the tissue paper circle, using water colors
for the purpose. Write the invitation with red ink around the
circle just inside the blue border, or straight across above and
below the centre.</p>

<p>Although the party is to be informal, a note written in the first
person does not harmonize with the impersonal nature of a firecracker,
therefore it is better to word the invitation something
like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Miss Mary Brown requests the pleasure of the Misses Green’s company
at an informal lawn frolic on Wednesday, the Fourth of July, from four to
six o’clock. Active games.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;"><a id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="525" height="229" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3.—The note of invitation looks like this.</div>
</div>

<p>When the ink is quite dry pinch the paper together at the
centre, making it look something like a paper flower, twist it a
little, and tie on the point a piece of the white cotton string.
The string should be about ten inches long and must be tied at
the middle (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>). Drop one end of the string through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cylinder and, taking hold of the end, draw the invitation into
its envelope. Crush in the extra red paper at each end until it
fills the opening and leaves the string extending from the centre
(<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>). Write the address and the words, “Pull the long string,”
on the outside of the now almost perfect giant firecracker, and
deliver by hand, for such an invitation would be broken and
spoiled in going through the mail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"><a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="470" height="82" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.—Giant firecracker with invitation inside.</div>
</div>

<p>The following</p>

<p class='center'><b>Order of Entertainment</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is well adapted to the Fourth of July lawn frolic:</p>

<ul><li>Out-of-door Pantomime Charades.</li>
<li>Shuffle Race.</li>
<li>Hurling the Lance.</li>
<li>Daylight Fireworks.</li></ul>

<p>The programme opens with the not too vigorous game of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pantomime Charades.</b></p>

<p>This will give all the opportunity of taking part and alternately
acting and resting. Stake out the four corners of your
stage with groups of flags, driving their sticks into the ground
to hold them upright. Provide seats for the audience in front
of the stage and at the back or side arrange a screen as dressing
and green room for the actors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="600" height="401" alt="Photo of two young women and two young men with garden tools an funny sunhats" />
<div class="caption">Making Hay While the Sun Shines.</div>
</div>

<p>Divide the party into two sides of equal numbers and let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
first side choose a proverb to be acted out in pantomime and
guessed by the opposite side, which is taking the part of audience.
When the proverb is guessed the actors must retire and the other
side take the stage. If the subject of the first charade is not
guessed the same side must present another proverb, putting new
actors in the place of those who have just taken part. Not a word
must be spoken in the charade, but the actors must make their
meaning as clear as possible by good acting.</p>

<p>Our first illustration shows the out-of-door pantomime charade
in progress. The proverb is: “Make hay while the sun shines.”
This requires but one act as the first part, “Make hay,” and the
last part, “while the sun shines,” are both represented. Making
hay is acted out and that the sun is shining is implied by the
quaint sunbonnets and wide-brimmed hats worn by the actors.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Costumes Are Impromptu,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and may be prepared in a few minutes. The odd and most
charmingly becoming bonnets, somewhat resembling Dutch caps,
are made of newspapers, pinned in shape. The men’s wide-brimmed
hats are simply ordinary hats with wide brims made of
wrapping paper. Black derby hats were worn on this occasion,
but straw hats are better. The girls’ dresses are turned up in
front and pinned at the back. If checked gingham aprons are
worn looped up at one side they will add to the color effect of the
costume.</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Make the Sun-bonnet,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">take one folded sheet of a newspaper and turn the folded edge
back four inches (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). Fold down the corners like <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>,
put it on the head, bring the straight edge together at the back
and pin it with a large pin. Bend out the laps at the sides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you have made <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>; <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a> gives the pattern of the boy’s hat.
Cut a large circle from rather stiff, new wrapping paper; press it
down upon the top of the crown of a man’s straw hat; crease it
along the edge of the crown, then cut a hole in the centre two
inches within the creased line. Slash from the inner edge to the
creased line as shown in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, fit the paper brim over the crown
of the straw hat and pin in place to the hat band.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 6.—Fold down the two corners.</div>

<p>High peaked hats, wide collars, and even short capes may be
quickly manufactured from paper and the effect of the impromptu
costume is marvelously good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Shuffle Race,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">next in order, is new and it is funny. Its requisites are, for the
girls, short skirts, held well above the ankles, and low shoes or
slippers many times too large, worn over ordinary shoes. Unless
the foot can be lifted out of the shoe without touching it with
the hands the shoe is too small. For the boys you must provide
the largest sized slippers obtainable, having uppers only at
the toes.</p>

<p>The course should be about one hundred feet over a smoothly
shaven lawn. The contestants must stand in line at the starting
point and at the word “go,” start off on the race, shuffling along
as fast as possible. The boys have no advantage over the girls
in this game, for it is no easier for one to cover the distance quickly,
shuffling along in the large shoes, than for the other, and both
look equally ridiculous in their absurdly frantic efforts to win
the race.</p>

<p>After resting from the shuffle race allow your guests to try their
skill at</p>

<p class='center'><b>Hurling the Lance.</b></p>

<p class="unindent">From the limb of a tree have suspended five or six feet from the
ground a small wooden hoop, about eighteen inches in diameter,
covered like a drumhead with white tissue paper.</p>

<p>Provide each player with a round, green, tapering stake, white
tipped and five feet long—the kind used for propping up plants.
On the blunt end of each stake, or lance, should be tied streamers
of red, white, and blue, which will make streaks of color as they
are sent hurtling through the air.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Burst of Daylight Fireworks.</b></p>

<p class="unindent">Strings of firecrackers stretched from tree to tree, bunches hidden
under barrels, harmless torpedoes for your guests to explode, and
any other fireworks that do not need darkness for a background
may be used.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to make</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Balloon Ascension</b></p>

<p class="unindent">an especial feature of the display. In the early days of our country
“Independence Day” was not to be thought of without a balloon
ascension, and the time-honored custom may be observed, but in a
new way. This part of the programme should come as a complete
surprise, and all the preparation for it be kept secret, that none of
your guests may suspect what you have in store for them. The
old observances always included a patriotic speech, and that, too,
should form a part of the ceremony, being used as an introduction
to the balloon ascension. You may make the speech yourself or
get some one to do it for you, but in either case let it be quite
short. Balloons should not be mentioned, but in some way the
old Grecian myth of Pandora and her wonderful box must be
brought in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Myth</b></p>

<p class="unindent">can be used quite appropriately and effectively for, as you will
remember, it was to punish Prometheus, and mankind in general,
for stealing fire that Zeus commanded Hephæstus to form from
earth this most beautiful Pandora, in order that by the charms
with which the other gods endowed her, she might bring trouble
and vexation upon them. It does not appear to have been altogether
her charms, however, that worked the mischief, for we
are told it was curiosity that induced her to open the box, or
cask, which was filled with winged blessings for men, thus
allowing all of the blessings except hope to escape. As the remarks
are being brought to a close have your</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pandora Box</b></p>

<p class="unindent">carried out and placed in front of the speaker.</p>

<p>In this case the box is to be a good-sized sugar-barrel, wrapped
in flags, or red, white, and blue bunting, and having a lid that is
easily lifted. With the final words let the speaker step forward
and suddenly raise the lid of the barrel. This will set free not
the things that were in the original Pandora box, but a number of
gas-filled, rubber, toy balloons, that will burst out like a volley of
fireworks, for a moment filling the air with color and movement,
then sailing upward and away to finally disappear from view in
the blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>In preparing your Pandora box choose a barrel that is perfectly
smooth inside, without long splinters or nails to pierce the fragile
balloons. Then see that the cover has a handle or knob by which
it can be lifted. A spool fastened on with a screw will serve very
well and is easily grasped by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Balloons</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are the kind one sees for sale on the streets tied in great bunches
by their long strings. Red is the most common color, but sometimes
they vary. Frequently there are white ones with red or
yellow lettering and bands, and again, just before the Fourth,
red, white, and blue ones may be found. Have all the colors
possible, and crowd in as many as the barrel will hold, cutting
the strings off close to the balloons that they may not become
entangled, and taking great care that they do not escape, like the
blessings, before their time.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAKE your poster as nearly as possible
like the one on the opposite page.
Paint the lettering in gay colors on
a big sheet of paper and a day before
the show tack it up in a conspicuous
place where all the family
will see it, for, of course, your show
must have an audience, and if you follow out all directions very
carefully it will be well worth seeing.</p>

<p>Have your circus on top of a large table, or on the floor, or
out of doors on the bare ground. Almost any place will do where
there is a good-sized level surface.</p>

<p>Make the circus ring about forty inches in diameter, outline
it with chalk and cover the marked line with either sawdust or
dry corn meal built into a narrow ridge similar to that of earth
around the large rings; then your circle will look just like the ring
of a real circus.</p>

<p>Be sure to have some kind of music at your show, if only music
on a comb. Place a piece of paper over the comb and play a
lively march. Let all the music be sprightly and gay.</p>

<p>Following the method given for making the horse and elephant,
you can make various other moving animals.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 gives the pattern
of the horse and
rider, which you can
trace on stiff cardboard,
not too heavy. If enlarged
to twice the size
given they will be more
imposing, but this is not
necessary, as the size of
pattern is very good.</p>

<p>When outlined cut
out the design, let the

a full double tissue-paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
skirt of the same color by gathering a strip of light-blue
tissue paper through the lengthwise centre, folding the edges together
and tying this double skirt around the little lady’s waist.
Cut a narrow strip of the same blue paper and fasten one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
around each wrist that it may float freely in the air as she gallops
around the ring.</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Give the Horse Ability to Move,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">pierce four holes through the body with a large needle, as in
<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. Be sure to have the holes in the right places that the
horse may balance perfectly; then when the threads are in
position there will be no difficulty in making the horse stand and
walk alone, as a well-trained steed should.</p>

<p>Use four pieces of strong black thread, all of the same length,
about forty inches, for leading the horse. Tie all four ends of the
thread together, and make a large knot in each strand seventeen
inches from the joined ends. Run each thread through a separate
hole in the body of the horse. Slide the horse against the
knots tied in the thread and then tie a second knot in each thread
close up to the other side of the horse.</p>

<p>Be very particular about these knots; they should rest against
the body of the horse, that the animal may be firmly inserted
between eight knots, four knots tight up against each side of his
body. Sew a tag of black tape on the thread where the ends are
tied together and pin the tag down to the floor in the centre of the
circus ring.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Tie the Ends</b></p>

<p class="unindent">E and F (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>) together and fasten them to a piece of pasteboard;
do likewise with the ends of the threads G and H, then
hold the two threads which are near the front of the horse, E and
F (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>), in one hand and the other two threads, G and H, in
the other hand while you walk slowly around the outside of
the ring, allowing little Rosebud to ride demurely around in a
circle, as such performers always do when they first enter a real
circus ring.</p>

<p>After the audience has been duly impressed by the novel sight
of a paper horse and rider moving, apparently without aid, around
the ring, the black threads being practically invisible, let the horse
stand alone while you bring out two or three brightly colored
tissue-paper banners, with each end of each scarf pasted on the
top of a spool. Place the banners at various distances around the
ring; then again take up the threads and</p>

<p>This done, remove the banners and let the horse with his pretty

<p class="unindent">Make them all of stiff cardboard and larger if possible than the
diagram; then with pen and ink draw the ears, eyes, and tusks
(<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>); waterproof drawing ink is best for this purpose, but
common ink will do. When the ink is dry give all parts, except
the tusks, a light wash of India ink, to turn the animal a natural
dull gray color. With black thread fasten the leg A on the far
side of the elephant, running the thread through the hole A in
the elephant and tying the thread into a large knot on the leg,
then making another knot on the near side of the body; the leg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and body are fastened to each other in this way between two knots
of thread. Have the pieces close together, but loose enough to
allow the leg to move easily. Attach the next leg, B, on the near
side of the body at the hole B. The leg C goes on the far side
of the body at the hole C, and the leg D on the near side at the
hole D. The legs A and C are on the far side, and B and D on
the near side of the animal (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>). Sew one end each of two
strands of black thread to a small piece of black tape. Make a
large knot in each thread, eighteen inches from the tape, run the
free end of each thread through one of the two holes high on the
elephant’s body (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>), and slide the elephant on the threads
close to the knots. Make other knots on this side of the body,
in the same way you managed the Kentucky charger, then pin the
tape to the centre of the ring and</p>

<p>If the horse and rider interfere, take them away and let the
unparalleled animal have the field to himself. When Bob goes
around the ring he always gets tired and draws back, declining to
move another step. Make him do this by gently pulling the back
thread backward. Bob is very comical when assuming this pose
(<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>). Raise the front thread and the little fellow will sit up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a><br /><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>). Slowly and gently raise both threads a trifle and Bob
will begin to dance (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). Raising the back thread a little,
not enough to take his foot from the ground, and at the same
time lowering the front thread, will cause Bob to crouch and crawl
along (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a> shows Bob when he is in a hurry. Make
this by lowering the front thread of <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

the spool, where he will naturally rest one foot on top while he takes
a long breath before climbing up (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>). Move the threads
carefully and the elephant will climb on the spool (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>). Lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the back thread, and Bob will slowly and cumbersomely raise
up until he balances himself on one fore foot on top of the spool
(<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>). By cautiously moving the threads you can make the
elephant lower himself and step down and off (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>). When
the animal is entirely off the spool, raise up and back the front
thread and he will sit down upon the top of the spool to rest (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig.
24</a>). Without any trouble Bob can stand erect on the spool, as
in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p>The horse can go rapidly, but the elephant, to be lifelike, must
move slowly. When the circus is over roll the threads on their
respective pieces of cardboard and bits of tape to avoid tangling
them, and have a box ready in which the animals may lie flat until
again needed.</p>

<p>This little circus will make a fine parlor entertainment, or
would do admirably as a side show at your next fair, when a small
extra admission could be charged and wee glasses of lemonade
and tiny popcorn balls passed around to the audience in true
circus style.</p>

this new Easter game, showers of
color will fill the air, sometimes descending
in sparkling bits of orange,
again reds, then greens or blues,
yellows or purples, with all their beautiful tints. Quivering and
shimmering, down the colored rain will fall, lightly covering your
hair, clothing, and surrounding objects, while you stand, racket
in hand, watching the result of your stroke. Your companions,
seeing your success, will be eager to try their skill, also, with one
of the pretty magic eggs. These colored showers do not even
look wet, and they will not injure the most delicate of fabrics, for
they are composed of countless bits of bright tissue paper.</p>

<p class='center'><b>How to Prepare the Eggs</b></p>

<p>Select eggs as nearly of a size as possible; take one egg at
a time and with a very coarse needle carefully bore a hole in
each end by pressing the point of the needle
against the shell and then turning the needle
around and around until a little hole appears.
Be very careful when boring not to press the
needle with too great a force, as there is danger
in so doing of cracking the shell and rendering
it useless. When both holes are made, increase
the hole on the large end of the egg until it is
about as large around as the head of a common
hat-pin (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>), then place the small end to
your lips and blow out the contents.</p>

<p class='center'><b>After the Shells Are Emptied</b></p>

<p class="unindent">leave one white and color all the others, making each shell of a
different color. When this is done, allow the inside of the shells
to become thoroughly dry; then fill them with pieces of tissue
paper cut in small squares a
quarter of an inch or less in
size. These can be quickly
made by folding the tissue
paper like <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a> and cutting
it into strips of fringe
(<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>); then cutting off the
ends of the fringe little by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

to the color of the shell. Fill
the white shell with squares of
white tissue paper, and when
the shell breaks in mid-air, the shower will resemble the dainty
petals of cherry blossoms as they fall when shaken from the trees

with a sharp pair of scissors clip off the point (A, <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>). This
makes the hole in the centre of the star (B, <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>). Through
the hole in each star thread the two ends of
a strong string. Cover the under side of the
star with paste, separate the two ends of the
string and hold them down on each side of
the egg (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>), then draw the star down on
to the shell over the strings, and press tightly
in place until the paste holds (<a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>). Clip
off the ends of the string that extend below
the star.</p>

<p>When the paste is quite dry and the paper firmly attached
to the shell,</p>

<p class='center'><b>Hang One of the Eggs</b></p>

<p class="unindent">directly in the middle of a wide
doorway so that the egg will be
about as high as the shoulders
of the players. If there is a curtain
pole in the doorway tie the
string to the pole; if not, drive
a tack on top of the door frame
and suspend the egg from that.
Where the doorway is quite wide,
like the old-fashioned doors between
two parlors, two eggs may
be hung and four players take
part at one time. In that case
you will need four rackets; ordinarily
two rackets are sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>Make the Rackets</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of flat rattan, taking two pieces, twenty-seven inches long for each
racket. Soak the rattan to make it pliable, then bind the two
pieces together with string as in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. Bend the now double
rattan to form a loop, bring the four ends together and wrap
them into a straight piece for the handle (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 39.—Bring the four ends

</div>

<p>Lay the frame you have just made down on a large piece of
strong writing-paper and mark a line on the paper one inch
from and entirely surrounding the outer edge of the frame down
to the handle. Draw another line close to the outer edge of the
frame, then cut out the design along the outside line. Slash the
edge up to, but not across, the remaining pencil line (<a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>).
Cover one side of the slashed border with paste or glue, and,
again placing the frame on the paper, turn the flaps, one at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
time, over the edge of the frame and attach them firmly to the
frame and to the inside of the paper (<a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>). When the paste
is perfectly dry, make another paper cover in the same manner
and paste its slashed edge over the frame on top of the first, putting
one cover directly over the other and so making it double;
this will make the racket quite strong and firm.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Game of Egg Tennis</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is played in couples, and the object is to break the egg-shell and
send the paper rain flying in the air. The sport is adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
all ages, from the little child scarcely large enough to wield the
racket to grown girls and boys, and even older people will become
excited as they try to strike the fragile toy.</p>

<p>The players must stand facing each other at equal distances
from and on opposite sides of the suspended egg. The distance
is decided by swinging the egg and then placing the players
within easy reach of it before it swings above their heads. This
is done by the umpire, who takes charge of the game and decides
any disputes.</p>

<p>Promptly at the signal,</p>

<p class='center'><b>“Ready,”</b></p>

<p class="unindent">given distinctly by the umpire, the player who has been appointed
starter gently swings the egg outward toward her opponent, and
the egg is then “in play.” The other player immediately tries
to strike the egg with her racket, using sufficient force to break the
shell or send it flying swiftly toward the first player, who in turn
promptly hits or misses the egg. Whether struck or not, the
egg will return to the other player, who will surely be able to
strike it the second time it comes to her, if not the first. And so
the egg is kept swinging rapidly back and forth between the two
players until the shell is broken. With the breaking of the shell
comes the beautiful shower of tissue paper which is sent flying
through the room by the stroke, and the player who releases it
wins a point in the game.</p>

<p class='center'><b>When the First Egg is Broken</b></p>

<p class="unindent">a second one must be put in its place, and the unsuccessful contestant
has another opportunity to make good her record, playing
with the same opponent. If the breaking of the second egg
proves a tie—that is, if it is broken by the player who was at
first unsuccessful—a third egg must be suspended and the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
couple continue to play until that, too, is broken. Then the
unsuccessful player drops out of the game, and the winner of
two points to his opponent’s one steps aside to await his final
play after the other couples have had their turn. Should one
player win two points in succession the third is not played, for
two points lost sends a player out of the game.</p>

<p>When all the couples have played, the successful competitors
alone remain in the game. These form new couples and play
as before, each in his order. This time there is but one egg for
each couple, and the player who fails to break the shell must
withdraw, giving his place to the next player, while the successful
one holds his place until another breaks the egg. In this way
but one player comes out victorious.</p>

<p>When space allows two eggs to be hung in the doorway and
two couples take part at the same time, there must be two umpires,
one for each couple, for in the excitement of the fray, one
person cannot watch all the play.</p>

<p class='center'>RULES OF THE GAME</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The umpire may not take part in the game while acting as umpire.
She shall keep tally and decide all questions which arise regarding the
game.</p>

<p>2. The egg shall not be struck except with the flat face of the racket.</p>

<p>3. When an egg is broken by striking against the surrounding woodwork,
or in any other manner other than with the face of the racket, it
counts one against the player who made the stroke and scores one for his
opponent.</p>

<p>4. Two points scored during one play declares the successful competitor
the victor.</p>

<p>5. A play consists of any number of trials until the two eggs are
broken.</p>

<p>6. Two eggs shall constitute a play when there is no tie; in case of a
tie there shall be three eggs.</p>

<p>Butterflies as well as eggs are appropriate for Easter and the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Butterfly Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">will come in well as second on your programme.</p>

<p>All the girls are butterflies in this game and all the boys are
collectors. The collectors are stationed in different parts of
the room and stand some distance, at least six feet, apart. They
may not move their feet to step in any direction, but, standing
in one spot, may reach out on all sides with their hands as they
try to catch the butterflies flitting past them.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Each Butterfly</b></p>

<p class="unindent">must lift the skirt of her dress with both hands and move it back
and forth as she flies among, around and between the collectors.
This moving of skirts as mimic wings makes the game appear
very pretty to the onlookers, and the collectors find it difficult to
grasp the fluttering draperies.</p>

<p class='center'><b>It is the Part of Every Collector</b></p>

<p class="unindent">to catch as many butterflies as possible and as each butterfly is
caught she must stand close behind the collector to whom she
belongs. The second captive stands behind the first with her
hands on the shoulders of number one. The third takes her place
behind number two with her hands on the shoulders of number
two and so on to</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Last Captive</b></p>

<p>The game becomes exciting when but one free butterfly is
left, darting about, skilfully evading the outstretched hands of the
collectors, each intent upon capturing this last and greatly
valued prize. For in the count the last butterfly captured is
equal to two of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The game ends when all are caught and the winner is he who
possesses the greatest number of butterflies, counting the last one
caught as two.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Magic Dye Kettle</b></p>

<p class="unindent">will be a unique, amusing and mystifying feature in the entertainment
of your guests. For this some preparation is necessary.</p>

<p>First you must have the tinsmith remove the bottom of a
new, inexpensive, tin kettle, one that has a lid to fit and will hold
several quarts. Then in the bottom of a square wooden box,
about as large as a small table, have a hole cut a trifle smaller
than the bottom of the kettle. Knock out one side of the box,
stand it bottom side up so that the round hole will be on top,
place it in the position it is to occupy, and throw over it some
kind of a cover which will reach to the floor and hide the box
completely on all sides. In this cover you must cut a hole to
fit the hole in the box, and place the hole in the cover directly
over the hole in the box. Place the lid on the kettle and stand
the kettle over the hole and it will appear to be merely sitting
on the table, as there will be nothing to indicate the opening
beneath.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Under the Box,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">ready for use, place a shallow tin pan larger around than the bottom
of the kettle, and cover the bottom of the pan with sawdust;
also place under the box a basket filled with hard boiled eggs
of various colors, three eggs of each color.</p>

<p>In another part of the room have ready another basket containing
the same number of hard boiled eggs but all uncolored.</p>

<p>While the Butterfly game is in progress let some one who is
in the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Secret of the Magic Kettle,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">hide under the improvised table and at a given signal lift the
shallow pan and hold it tightly under the hole in the box.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Explain to your guests that you have for the occasion a magic
kettle, which, while they wait, will color eggs for them without
water and without heat. Pass around the basket of uncolored
eggs and invite each one to take an egg. Tell three members of
the party to decide upon a color they wish their eggs dyed (all
three must be the same color) then, as you raise the lid, to shout
the color in unison, and carefully place their eggs in the kettle.</p>

<p>As soon as the eggs are in quickly replace the lid and wave
your hands back and forth over the kettle. Apparently you will
be working a charm, but in reality you will be keeping the too
curious from taking a peep into the kettle to see what process is
going on.</p>

<p>When the uncolored</p>

<p class='center'><b>Eggs are in the Kettle</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and the lid is on, your assistant underneath must gently and
without the least noise lower the pan she is holding, and in which
the eggs have been deposited, remove the uncolored eggs and
substitute three others of the color she has heard wished for.
Then lifting the pan she must again hold it close under the
kettle until</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Colored Eggs are Taken Out</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and three more put in to be dyed.</p>

<p>Give your assistant several minutes to make the exchange of
eggs, then lift the lid and allow the eggs, so quickly and so marvellously
colored, to be lifted out by their owners.</p>

<p>When all the eggs have been dyed lead your guests from
the room without allowing any investigation of the workings of
the magic kettle and while they are out have box, kettle and
eggs taken away so that the charm of mystery may not be broken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A DOORWAY PUNCH AND JUDY SHOW</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_065-drop_e.jpg" width="86" height="105" alt="E" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">EVERYBODY laughs when he sees
Mr. Punch, with his funny long nose,
and his wife Judy in her frilled cap.
The show is all fun, every bit of it;
even the little baby seems to understand
and appears actually pleased
when Punch and Judy toss him back
and forth, as they might a rubber
ball. When the infant happens to
fall, he is never hurt; the accident is
but a good joke and part of the sport.
One great charm about the show is, that you can make Punch
and his family do exactly as you please and say exactly what you
want them to say, for so long as you are showman they yield
implicit obedience to your will.</div>

<p>The only material necessary for</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Stage</b></p>

<p class="unindent">will be a piece of plain solid-colored cloth, which must reach
across an open doorway, be tacked upon each side and extend
down to the floor, where it should be again fastened that
there may be no danger of its blowing aside. Put this curtain up
high enough in the doorway to reach a trifle above your head, for
you must be completely hidden from the audience. The full-page
illustration shows the back of the stage and gives the manner
in which Punch and his family are made to move about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the opening between the top of the doorway and the curtain.
It is this opening which constitutes the stage. The illustration
also shows a band of cloth stretched across the extreme top of
the doorway, and short side curtains added to the outside of the
stage to improve its appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;"><a id="Fig_42"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 42.—Draw Punch’s head like this.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>To Make Punch’s Head,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">cut a piece of unruled white writing-paper eight inches long and
five inches wide, to allow a generous margin, and on it draw <a href="#Fig_42">Fig.
42</a>, making the head 6 inches across one way and 4 inches the
other. Paste a strip of thin cloth over the neck which includes the
entire space between the four corners marked A-A-A-A, and
over this cloth paste two more cloth strips in the spaces marked
B-B and B-B. The cloth strengthens the neck and prevents it
from tearing while the head is in motion. Carefully mark the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a><br /><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
features, copying them also on the right-hand side of the face (D).
Cut out the head, including flaps, and the ears along their outer
edge. Cut the line of the chin into each side of the neck as far as
the second strips of cloth (B-B and B-B). Roll the neck until it fits
loosely on your first finger, then paste it together like a ring. Paste
the tips of each side of the nose together, also those of the chin.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43.—The top of

</div>

<p>Bend the flaps at the dotted line on the edge of the face and
paste the other side of the face part way over the flaps, covering
the spaces C-C-C-C. If the head seems too narrow, bend the
paper out to make it appear wider. Roll an
extra piece of writing-paper and fit it inside the
head. Be sure that the roll lies evenly and is
close up against the inside of the head; then
bend out the ears, paste the paper lining in place
and paint the entire head pink except the eyes
and teeth. When the first color is dry, paint the
markings on the ears red; the hair and eyebrows,
markings for teeth and the eyes black; the
lips, nose, chin and cheeks a brilliant red.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 44.—Make the hand in the shape
of a mitten.</div>
</div>

<p>The top of Punch’s head is open (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>), but we will cover
it with a high, pointed cap, and the uncovered space where the
chin comes forward beyond the neck will not be noticed when
Punch is dressed, for the double ruffle around his neck hides all
deficiencies. Make each arm of a roll of writing-paper pasted
together along the edge. The roll
must be about four and three-quarter
inches long. Flatten and
paste together one end of each
arm, and on these flat ends draw
the outline of a mitten, which will serve as a hand; when the paste is
dry, cut out the mitten (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>). Paint the hands and arms pink.</p>

<p>The arms should
fit loosely over the
ends of your thumb
and forefinger. <a href="#Fig_45">Fig.
45</a> gives the pattern
of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Punch’s Dress</b></p>

<p>Make it much larger,
according to the dimensions
given on patterns, and let it be
of soft material in very bright, gay colors.
The front and back are exactly alike, and
the two pieces are sewed together at the
sides, the seams extending to within two
inches of the bottom of the skirt, leaving
the sides split up that distance. Slide the
paper arms up in the sleeves and fasten
them in place at the top with a drop or
two of glue. Make a wide, white double
ruffle, slip it on Punch’s neck and push it
up against the head. Then gather the top
of the dress so that it will fit Punch’s neck,
and fasten it on under the ruffle with strong
glue, allowing the bottom of the paper neck
to extend down below the gathered top of
the dress. Make a high cap of brilliant
red cloth to fit Punch’s head; trim it with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
turned up band of vivid green edged with white and glue the cap
to the head. With a stitch or two or an elastic band fasten an
inked paper lighter in his right hand to serve as a stick.</p>

<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="224" height="307" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 47.—Judy will look like this.</div>
</div>

<p>Now slip the first finger of your left hand up in Punch’s neck,
run your thumb and second finger of the same hand in the paper
arms, and make Punch turn and twist his head while he gesticulates
with both arms. You will laugh before you know it, and
be delighted with your funny old Punch (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>Make Judy’s Head</b></p>

<p class="unindent">by the pattern used for the head of Punch, but omit the ears and
cut off the ends of both nose and chin. They should not be so
long for Judy. Strengthen the neck with cloth and fasten the
head together as you did that
of Punch. Make blond hair
of two pieces of yellow tissue
paper pasted in narrow irregular
folds on the inside of the
top opening of the head; then
bring over and down on the
outside as if combed loosely
over Judy’s ears. Paste the
lower ends of the paper hair
above the neck on the back
of the head. Paint Judy’s
eyes blue. In all other respects
than the details mentioned,
make Judy’s head the same as
you did that of Punch. Make
her arms and hands the same,
the double ruffle for the neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the same, the dress the same cut but of contrasting color. Cut
Judy’s cap from thin white material, make it circular and gather
it entirely around, about one inch from the edge. Attach strings
of the same material, and tie them under Judy’s chin (<a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Baby</b></p>

<p class="unindent">must be quite light in weight. Make it of a piece of pink tissue
paper about eight inches square. Draw the paper through
your hands several times to crush it into small folds, then, while
it is crushed together, double at the middle and wind a thread
around near the folded end to form a neck, leaving half an inch
above for the head. Gather a piece of white tissue paper around
the baby’s neck to make its dress, and cut a straight strip of
white tissue paper for the baby’s cap. Lay it flat on top of the
head and bring the two ends down straight on each side of the
face. Gather the cap at the back, add strings and fasten it on
the baby’s head. Features may be marked on the face with
paint, but be very careful not to use much water with the colors,
for water will melt the tissue paper face.</p>

<p class='center'><b>When All is Ready</b></p>

<p class="unindent">slip Judy on one hand, Punch on the other hand, and make
them talk and act to the best of your ability. Assume deep tones
of voice when you talk for Punch, and high, shrill tones for Judy;
make the play short, full of life and action, and as funny as
possible. Of course, you will have to practise with Punch,
Judy and the baby in front of a mirror before giving your show
in order to see how they will look as you make them act, and
to learn just how to manage them.</p>

the baby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Punch</span>: Now let’s dance. (<i>The music plays and the two dance and
sing some popular air, then together bow to the audience, saying</i>:) Good-by
little girls and boys, good-by, everybody. We’ve had such a good time.
Good-by, good-by.</p></div>

<p>The flags may be of home or store manufacture, but they
must be fastened on paper sticks, made like Punch’s paper-lighter
stick. They can all be American flags, or three other nations
may be represented, or each flag can be of solid color, differing
from all the others, as red, green, yellow and blue.</p>

<p>If a companion will help with the show by taking complete
charge of Judy while you attend to Punch, the management will
be much easier, for then you will have only one doll to make talk
and act.</p>

<div class="drop-cap">THIS year the annual festival of the
fairies is to be celebrated with
wilder pranks and madder mysteries
than for many a long
season, and if we enter heartily
into the spirit of the fun and make
preparations for them, the little
folks will surely reveal many
secrets the future holds in store
for us.</div>

<p>Ask the fairies, gnomes and
elves to your Hallowe’en frolic;
they will be delighted to come, though of course, you cannot invite
them in the usual fashion. Instead of writing notes, you
must braid three</p>

<p class='center'><b>Invitation Rings of Grass—</b></p>

<p class="unindent">fresh grass is best, but the dried will do—and hang the rings on
bushes (<a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>), or lay them on the outside window-sill, making
a wish on each grass ring as it is put into place. To insure the
fulfilment of the wish, you must not see the rings again until
after Hallowe’en. The fairy troupe will find the green circles
as they come floating along through the air on gay-colored bubbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from the magic spring waters of Fairyland. During the last
days of October fairies are always looking for such invitations.</p>

<p>Here are some of the
ceremonies and games
newly revealed to me by
the old witch who lives
in the black clouds that
sail southward on the
northwest wind.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Black Cats,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">the friends and companions
of witches, are
wonderful creatures to
conjure with, but all
cats can work a charm,
and it is cats, or preferably
kittens, you must
have for the first rite.
There must be a pussy
in hiding for each girl
and boy present at the Hallowe’en frolic. With different colored
bright ribbons tie a tinkling bell around the neck of every cat,
leaving one end of the ribbon one yard long. Seat your Hallow-e’en
guests in a semicircle around the room. Ask them to sit
quietly for a few moments, and suddenly put out the lights.
With the room in total darkness let absolute stillness ensue for a
second; then say very slowly and distinctly:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 473px;">
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="473" height="391" alt="drawing of four children watching four kittens with  ribbons tied round their necks race" />
<div class="caption">Kittens Telling Who Will be the First to Marry.</div>
</div>

<p>“Hold out your right hand and there will come to each one
of you a disguised gnome or fairy. Be very gentle and kind to
the little creature (here pause for a moment); for if by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
chance ill befall the disguised sprite the fairies will be angry
and will do nothing for you until next Hallowe’en.” Again
pause; then say: “So I caution you once more—be kind and
gentle.”</p>

<p>Have some one keep the kittens near by, in readiness, so that
you may lead all into the darkened room without a moment’s
delay. Hold the ends of the ribbons in one hand while with
the other you take one ribbon at a time, and as you pass along
the line place it in the outstretched hand of each successive
guest, saying as you do so, “Hold fast this magic clue.” The instant
the last ribbon has been given to a guest, turn on the lights
and while the girls and boys are looking with surprise at the
little creature they hold captive and laughingly exchanging comments,
you must pin a piece of white tape on the floor across
one end of the room about four feet from the wall. Request the
guests to kneel, with their funny little gnomes, in a row on the
enclosed space next to the wall, and face the tape. Announce
that there will now take place the race of fate. Each player
must hold his or her pussy with its fore paws directly on the tape,
and at a given signal all the girls and boys must exclaim in unison,
“Run!” at the same time releasing the kittens that they may
scamper away in any direction they choose. The guests should
remain stationed back of the tape line and watch them as they
scatter wildly over the room trailing their bright streamers. No
one may touch or in any way molest a kitten after the signal has
been given to let them go. The girl or boy whose pussy first
reaches the centre of the room, which has previously been marked
with a second strip of tape, will be the first to marry.</p>

<p>Do not wait for the other kittens to make the goal, but gather
up the little creatures and lead them away to be seen no more,
or the spell will be broken.</p>

<p>Old shoes possess strange and occult powers as we all know,
else why should we throw them after the coach of a newly wedded
couple? So we must have a</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pair of Old Slippers</b></p>

<p class="unindent">After the last cat has disappeared, bring out the slippers; any
kind except toy ones will do. Place the slippers on a sheet of
white paper laid on the top of
a table where all present may
see.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 209px;"><a id="Fig_49"></a>
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="209" height="135" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 49.—Place one slipper on top of the other.</div>
</div>

<p>Explain to the girls and
boys that they must take one
turn each in trying their fortunes
by putting one slipper
crosswise on top of the other,
both right side up (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>),
and while holding them so, repeat the following verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Will my love be dark? Will my love be fair?</div>
<div class="verse">What future is mine? I pray you show</div>
<div class="verse">By the turning of sole or the pointing of toe!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lift the paper and give the slippers a slight upward toss to
fall on the floor as they may, and the manner in which they
reach the floor indicates the fortune:</p>

<p>When both slippers land upside down and do not touch, the
player will be a great traveller and have no settled home.</p>

<p>When both slippers land right side up and do not touch, the
player will go on the stage.</p>

<p>When the right slipper is upside down, the future mate will
be cross and selfish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When the left slipper is upside down, the future mate will be
unselfish and kind.</p>

<p>When the slippers are crossed there will be an early marriage.</p>

<p>When the toes of the slippers point in opposite directions,

<p>When the toes of the slippers point in the same direction,

marble crossed by different colored lines).</p>

<p>Set three cups in a row (<a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a>), under one place a “crystal,”
under another a “commie,” and under the last a “china.” Blindfold
each player in turn and let the girl or boy raise one of the
cups. If the marble under the lifted cup is the crystal, the husband
or wife will be young and life will be easy and full of sunshine.
If it is the china, the husband or wife will be middle aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and life will be hard but famous. If the commie, the husband
or wife will be old, and life will be filled with adventure. The
marbles must be changed into different cups after blindfolding
each player.</p>

<p>Give every one an apple and a wooden toothpick. Each
player may push the toothpick in any part of the apple; the spot
occupied by the toothpick tells the fortune, but the apple must
be kept in one position, and on no account turned after the
toothpick is once in. When all have inserted the toothpicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
each boy and girl in turn must hold up his or her apple that all
may see while you read the fortune.</p>

<p>When the toothpick stands straight and erect in the top of
the apple, the life partner will be an American (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>); if in
the left side of the apple, the mate will be English (<a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>); in the
right side, French (<a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>), in the back, German; in the front,
Italian; sideways at the top of the apple, the mate will be a
West Indian; sideways in the right side, the mate will be a Japanese;
in the left side, a Russian; in the front, Spanish. When
the toothpick breaks the player will not marry.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 56.—You must prepare a card like this
for the Wedding Race.</div>
</div>

<p>Now comes the fun of forecasting to learn where the wedding
will take place, so prepare for</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Wedding Race</b></p>

<p>For this you must have a
card like <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>; fill in the
spaces under “The way you go”
with the following words according
to the numbers: (1)
Walk slowly,(2) Walk backward,
(3) Walk on toes, (4)
Walk on heels, (5) Run, (6)
Walk fast, (7) Skip, (8) Walk
without raising feet, (9) Run
on toes, (10) Walk on toes of
one foot and the heel of the
other, (11) Run on heels, (12)
Walk sideways.</p>

<p>In the spaces under “Wedding”
insert: (1) Church, (2)
On shipboard, (3) Boarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
house, (4) Hotel, (5) Home, (6) Friend’s home, (7) Top of mountain,
(8) Minister’s house, (9) Tent, (10) Out of Doors, (11)
Courthouse, (12) Cave. Inform the guests that each in turn
must go the length of the room. He or she may walk slowly,
walk fast, walk sideways, walk backward, walk on toes, walk
on heels, walk on the toes of one foot and the heel of the other,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>If many guests are present, start two at a time crossing the
room, one from each end. Write the initial of every player on
the line of the card corresponding to the manner in which he or
she crosses the room; for example, if the first player’s name is
Barbara Carter, and she runs across the room, put down her
initials B. C. on the line No. 5 on which is written the word
“Run.” If the second player’s name is Jamie Bartlett and he also
runs write his initials J. B. on the same line of the card, but,
should Jamie decide to go backward across the room his initials
would then belong on line No. 2. When all the girls and boys
have crossed the room, and quiet again reigns, read to them the
various places where the different players will be married, for instance,
if referring to your card you find the initials of Jessie
Douglass on line No. 12, you should read, “Because Jessie
Douglass walked sideways across the room, she will be married
in a cave. Won’t that be romantic?” Always add some pleasant
remark after reading each record; such remarks make things
run easier and add to the fun. Probably you will be able to
think of many delightful little speeches, but in case you find any
difficulty, the following list may be of some assistance. Remark
for line No. 1: There could not be a better place. No. 2, How
charming. No. 3, Better there than not at all. No. 4, I wonder
if that will be a runaway match. No. 5, The dearest spot on
earth. No. 6, A friend in need is a friend indeed. No. 7, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a><br /><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hope we will all be invited. No. 8, An elopement, you may be
certain. No. 9, Delightful. So gypsy-like. No. 10, I am sure
there will be room for us all at this wedding. No. 11, Many a
happy marriage has taken place in a court-house. No. 12, Won’t
that be romantic?</p>

<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="409" height="498" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">The Vesper Rite.</div>
</div>

<p>The communicative old witch of the northwest wind imparted
so many methods of Hallowe’en fortune telling you can
take your choice. Here are the rest just as she told them.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Vesper Rite,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">if observed with due solemnity, will disclose the principal characteristics
of any one submitting to the test.</p>

<p>Take six large potatoes and cut them in half. Shape each
half into a candlestick by scooping out a round hole in the small
end, making it large enough to hold a candle.</p>

<p>Place a half candle in each of the potato candlesticks and pin
around each candle a strip of paper on which is written one
word indicating a trait of character, such as “modesty,” “bashfulness,”
“vanity,” etc.</p>

<p>Then form a magic ring of the candles in the centre of a
dimly lighted room. The ring should be about three feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>Blindfold one of the players and have the entire party join
hands and run three times around the lighted candles.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the blindfolded player standing two feet from
and facing the ring, let the others fall back while a chair is placed
before her, a fan is handed to her and she is told to make three
trials at fanning out the candles over the back of the chair.</p>

<p>After the third trial she must remove the bandage from her
eyes and examine the papers on the candles that are left burning,
reading aloud the words which reveal her character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>To avoid any danger of skirts catching fire, care must be
taken that no one approaches the candles too closely after they
are lighted.</p>

<p>Another game is called the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Bean Bag Test</b></p>

<p>Into a bag that will hold four or five quarts, pour three quarts
of dried beans and in their midst hide a ring, a thimble and a
brass button.</p>

<p>Have ready a bright new tin cup and let each player in turn
dip into the bag and take out a cupful of beans which must be
emptied into a plate.</p>

<p>If either a girl or boy finds the ring in the beans it is a sign of
an early marriage. If a girl gets the thimble she will be an old
maid, and when the thimble falls to the lot of a boy he will marry
an old maid.</p>

<p>The brass button in a girl’s cup of beans denotes that she
will marry a widower, but in a boy’s cup it is a bachelor’s button
and shows that he will be a bachelor all his life and will sew on
his buttons himself.</p>

<p>Each player can have but one trial, and if only beans fall to
her share, it signifies that her fate is still undecided.</p>

<p>Here is another test called</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Witch Screen</b></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 257px;"><a id="Fig_57"></a>

<p>Across the end or corner of the room fasten a breadth of inexpensive
cloth for the witch screen; old muslin or any material
most convenient will
answer the purpose if
not too thin. Through
the lengthwise centre
of the cloth cut two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
slits for each player. <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a> has eight slits and is intended for
four players. Seat the company in a row near to and facing the
witch screen, adjust it so that the slits will come on a level with
the hands of the players, then, standing behind the screen and
looking over the top, say, “I have some wonderful treasures
which the witches have loaned us for this evening, but, as the
objects are very valuable and must be returned, I ask that you
use the utmost caution in handling them, and take great care not
to drop or break any of the things while passing them from one
to another down the line.</p>

heated; place it in the hand at the head of the line with
the words, “I give you the charmed lava; pass it on.” Though
the girls and boys may not see what they have, they can assuredly
feel it, and there comes in the fun, for each in turn will be sorely
tempted to drop the hot potato and yet not dare to do so, and
no hint being given, the next neighbor
will in turn be equally startled.
When the lava reaches the last

at that end must receive the precious

difficulties successfully overcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but if dropped the fortune will be reversed. The porcupine
is in reality a chestnut bur.</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Harmless Serpent</b></p>

<p class="unindent">forms the fourth charm; it renders all girls and boys proof
against fear of wild animals, and imparts the faculty of taming
and making pets of many inhabitants of the forest, but the charm
will be lost with one failing to pass it on its way. The serpent is
a snake made of soft dough.</p>

<p>One of the best fairy gifts is</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Treasure from the Great Blue Sea</b></p>

<p class="unindent">It means a joyous ocean voyage to new and beautiful lands, but
if dropped, the player will encounter storms and perils. Hand
the first player a slippery raw oyster.</p>

<p>When all the charms have been tested, announce that before
returning the treasures to the witches you will place them on
exhibition; then turn back the witch screen and let the girls
and boys gather around the tray of queer charms, where they
can laugh and exchange comments to their hearts’ content.
The effect of the witch screen may be enhanced by using a
breadth of brilliant-red muslin and pasting on it black moons,
stars, cats, etc. Erect at each end of the screen a comic pumpkin
lantern head, with white paper fastened on the inside over
the features to light them up, instead of a real light placed inside.
Slide each pumpkin head on the end of a pole, and rest the pumpkin
firmly on four long, strong nails driven in around near the
top of the pole. The lower end of each pole may be steadied
and supported by being inserted in a hole bored through the
centre of a heavy piece of plank, where it must form a very tight
fit; or you can sink the pole into a deep pail of stones and earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
If it is possible to have the only light in the room placed back of
the screen, the effect produced will add to the mystery and enchantment.
Make all decorations as funny as you like, but
avoid anything grotesquely unpleasant. Let every item be agreeable,
from the least to the most important arrangement for the
evening’s fun.</p>

<p>A very pretty way of telling fortunes is with</p>

<p class='center'><b>Fairy Airships</b></p>

<p class="unindent">made of feathers. Take as many fluffy feathers as there are
girls and boys in the party and paste on each feather a prophecy
written on a bit of paper, such as:</p>

<ul><li>Yes,</li>
<li>No,</li>
<li>Sometime,</li>
<li>Possibly,</li>
<li>Never,</li>
<li>At twenty-five,</li>
<li>Probably,</li>
<li>Depends on myself,</li>
<li>If I can,</li>
<li>I’ll try,</li>
<li>When the time comes,</li>
<li>Of course,</li>
<li>Three times,</li>
<li>Before you know it,</li>
<li>Not if I can help it,</li>
<li>Certainly,</li>
<li>Doubtful,</li>
<li>Surely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all the fairy airships into a pasteboard box-lid, which
you have previously punched full of holes, and, standing on a
stool or chair, hold the box-lid high in the air while you slowly
and impressively say to the company: “These fairy airships
will decide your fate regarding marriage. Will you marry?”
At the word “marry” launch the ships of fate by fanning vigorously
under the box-lid with a large palm-leaf fan, which will
send the ships flying in every direction; as they sail through
the air each player must endeavor to catch one before it falls.</p>

<p>When order has been restored and all have their airships, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
girl and boy in turn must read aloud the prophecy brought by
the fairy vessel.</p>

<p>All the party will enjoy the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Blarney Stone Game</b></p>

<p>Place a large, clean stone on a doily-covered fancy plate which
rests on a table in the centre of the room, and tell your guests
that a certain spell cast on the famous Blarney Stone in Ireland
caused the virtues of that wonderful stone to be transmitted to
the stone in the very room where they stand, and that if a girl or
boy, when blindfolded, can walk up to the table and kiss the
Hallowe’en Blarney Stone, she or he will ever after be jolly and
happy and prove a most agreeable companion. Then tie a handkerchief
across the eyes of each of the players in turn and let
them walk up to and try to kiss the stone before the witches come
to take away the magic spell, which they will do long before the
clock strikes twelve at midnight.</p>

<p>During the evening be sure to try fortunes by the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Fortune Jingle</b></p>

<p>On different sheets of paper write one of the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<p>Place each verse in a separate envelope and hang all on a
string stretched and tied to the backs of two chairs. Distribute
squares of paper each marked with a number beginning at number
one. The player receiving number one has first choice of
envelopes from the line. Two brings second choice, and so on.
When all missives have been taken and the signal given for
opening the envelopes, the player receiving verse one reads
aloud, “One is good fortune”; immediately after the person
with number two reads, and the other verses follow in numerical
succession, every envelope bringing its gift to the recipient.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>DANCE OF TITANIA, QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_097.jpg" width="169" height="207" alt="T" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">TITANIA is a graceful little fairy, dancing
as though she had learned the
art from the bending of the grass in
a summer breeze, the swaying of
the trees or the flitting of butterflies
from flower to flower. Light, airy,
with gossamer wings and filmy
dress, looking as though she needed
nothing more substantial than silvery
moonbeams to dance upon, the
little queen leaves her home in the
deep, wild woods and comes to do your bidding.</div>

<p class='center'><b>Have Titania’s Stage Ready</b></p>

<p class="unindent">that she may not be kept waiting, for queens and fairies will
brook no delay (<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>). Find a wooden box 18½ inches long
by 13 inches wide or larger (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>). With a heavy hammer
or a hatchet pry up and knock off the top and one of the long
sides (<a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>). The open side forms the front of the roofless
stage.</p>

</div>

<p>The coloring of the stage should be a light sage green. If
possible, procure this color in cartridge wallpaper wider than
the stage. With a string measure the distance across the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wall of stage from top to bottom (A to B <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>), continue the
measurement in the same straight line across the floor of the
stage from back B to front C. After allowing five extra inches
for turning the paper over the top edge of the back wall A and
front edge of floor C, cut the length according to measurement.
To make the strip of green paper the required width measure
the exact distance across the inside back wall from side wall D
to side wall E, then fold the paper evenly along each lengthwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
edge, making it the width needed; unfold and adjust the paper
against the back wall over its top edge and over the floor of the
stage. Cut short slits on each side of the paper where the floor
and wall meet, that the extra width may lie flat up against the
side walls. Bend the top edge of the paper over the top of the
back wall, again slashing a little on each side to make it fit top
edge of wall. In the same way bend the paper over the front
edge of the floor; see that the paper lies perfectly smooth, then
fasten it in place with small tacks, using three tacks on the outside
at the back, one at each corner and one in the middle; two tacks
where floor and wall meet, and three underneath front of floor.
Measure the side walls, cut paper to fit and fasten the paper
on the walls with as few tacks as possible.</p>

<p>When the inside papering is finished, cover the outside of the
stage with pretty cretonne. Make four inside wings, two for each
side of the stage, to represent the foliage of trees. Cut two like
<a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>, from paper of a darker green than the walls of the stage
and reverse one of them that they may face each other. Then
make two wings, like <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>, from paper of a lighter green than
the walls, and reverse one of these also. The walls of the stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
with the two sets of wings will make three different tones of
green forming the background. Cut the wings long enough to
extend up as high or higher than the side walls of the stage.
Bend each strip lengthwise at dotted line and paste the bent
margin of one wing from <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a> on each side wall, running the
wing up from the floor to the top of the wall about four inches
from the back wall. In the same manner fasten the wings
(<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>) on each side wall three inches in front of the first or
back wing (<a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>).</p>

stage and let the lower edge of the
curve in the centre of the arch be
five and a half inches higher than
its two ends (see dotted line, <a href="#Fig_68">Fig.

five-eighths inches from top of head to lower edge of body. Cut

<p>Find a pretty head in some old paper or advertisement, cut
it out and gum it on the pasteboard head. Remember, though,
that the printed head must not be of very heavy paper, as the
upper part of the doll should be lighter in weight than the lower,
otherwise the figure will not balance. If you cannot find a head
in colors, you must paint the printed black-and-white one; give
the face, neck and arms a flat wash of light-pink water-color
paint; color the lips and cheeks red, the eyes blue and the hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
brown. Make the long stockings a darker pink than the light
flesh tones, and paste slippers of gilt paper on the feet.</p>

<p>Puncture a hole with a
coarse needle through the
centre of the belt-line (C,
<a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>). For</p>

<p class="unindent">make a skirt of plain white
tissue paper. Cut it sixteen
inches wide and three and
a half inches long, after
creasing the skirt by gathering
up the fulness with
your fingers and drawing
the skirt lengthwise from
top to bottom through
your partially closed hand.
Gather the top of the skirt
with thread and needle, and
fasten it on the doll, then slit
up each side from the lower
edge to allow of the free
motion of the doll’s limbs.</p>

<p>Make the dress of pink chiffon. Cut the dress skirt three and
three-fourth inches long and one yard wide, press it in knife-blade
plaits, running up and down, then gather and tie it on the doll
over the white tissue-paper skirt. Do not attempt to hem any
portion of the clothing, as the object is to keep it all light and
airy. Fashion the waist of a smooth strip of pink chiffon tied with
narrow pink ribbons at the shoulders and brought down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

a silver girdle of the tinsel ruching used on Christmas trees;
place the tinsel around the Queen’s waist, allowing the two free
ends to hang down over the front of the dress. Glue a little of
the same tinsel around the front of her dark hair, where it will
shine like a crown of diamonds. Make Titania daintily hold up
and out each side of her dress. Do this by stretching out the
sides of the dress skirt and gumming the material to each wrist.</p>

<p class="unindent">facing the light and, carrying the thread in your hand, take your
station two yards or more away from and in front of the stage;
then practise moving Titania by means of the thread until you
can make her glide, pose and dance in many graceful attitudes.
She will lean to the right and to the left, will stand on her toes,
then curtsey, making her dress touch the floor; she will move
gently and slowly, again faster and faster until her feet seem to
fairly twinkle over the stage floor; she will pass back and forth
almost as if floating from side to side of the stage, or stand in the
centre and dance. Titania is ever fascinating, beautiful and
graceful in all her movements. Ask some one to play on the
piano while you make the fairy Queen dance and she will keep
time to the music. When you have learned to make Titania
dance her prettiest invite your friends in to see the little fairy.</p>

<p>Examine the apple and make sure there are no raised ridges
in the paper and that the entire covering lies flat and smooth.
Tie one end of a piece of brown thread around the base of the
stem. Wind the long end of the thread once tightly around the
apple, giving it a twist around the stem to secure it in place (<a href="#Fig_84">Fig.
84</a>). The thread must pass across the exact centre of the blossom
end of the apple. As you wind the thread turn the fruit and
watch the thread that it may not swerve either to this side or
that. A second time wind the thread around the apple, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the first encircling thread band double. Cross this double band
with another double band, marking the apple into quarters, secure
the thread about the stem, and again wind it around the
apple, dividing two opposite quarters each into two pieces.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">may be played by any number. The object of the game is to
spin the apple so that it will hit one or more of the surrounding
pumpkins and roll or shove them on to the highest marked divisions
of the game-court.</p>

<p>Each player is allowed only one trial at a time, turns being
taken successively by the different players. The spinning of
the apple must always be started on the small central circle
where the apple is stationed. When the apple rolls off the board
the player may have another trial; if the apple rolls off on the
second trial she simply loses her turn, there being no other penalty.
When a pumpkin lands on one of the dividing lines it
counts ten against the player. Often an apple will strike several
pumpkins, sending them off on different divisions. Every pumpkin
then counts the number in the division on which it stops;
sometimes more than one pumpkin will land in the same division,
and each pumpkin so landing counts the number in that division.
When the apple sends but one pumpkin, the player scores merely
the number of that one division on which it lands. After each
play the pumpkins must be replaced in the circle ready for the
next player.</p>

<p>Five rounds constitute a game and the highest record scored
wins. When played by sides there must be an equal number of
players on each side. The side making the highest score wins
the game.</p>

<p>For the next game let all the players sit on the floor in a ring
and by the light of only wee pumpkin lanterns tell a</p>

<p class='center'><b>Rapid-Transit Thanksgiving Story</b></p>

<p class="unindent">The leader must begin the tale, which may or may not be original.
He must speak for only a few minutes, then stop, when his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>-hand
neighbor, without hesitation, must take up the story and
carry it on for a few moments. In this way the story goes the
round, each right-hand player in turn telling his part. Every
player has the privilege of making his portion of the tale original,
even though the preceding part may not be so. It is also the
privilege of every one to change the story to a dream, or a fairy
tale. Quotations may be introduced, verses recited, or snatches
of song sung; in fact, the oftener the story is twisted and turned
the greater the interest; but there must always be some connection
between the part being told and that which has gone before.
The entire romance must be finished before the light in the wee
pumpkins burns out. If a player should fail to continue the
story when his turn comes, he must pay a forfeit, and when the
story is finished, redeeming the forfeits adds to the fun.</p>

<p>If many guests are present, divide them into small groups
for the rapid-transit story.</p>

<p>Make a miniature</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pumpkin Lantern</b></p>

<p class="unindent">for each girl and boy present. Take a symmetrical apple which
stands firm and steady on the blossom end. Select the best side
for the face, and with the small blade of a penknife cut on it a
crescent with ends turned upward for the mouth. Cut a triangle
for the nose, two small squares for eyes, and two short crescents,
points turned upward, for eyebrows (<a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>).</p>

<p>Turn the apple over and cut an opening in the back as shown
at <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>. Be extremely cautious not to break or tear the edges
of the apple skin while cutting the features and back opening.
With the small blade of the penknife inserted at the back opening
cut away the inside of the apple little by little, taking great care not
to drive the knife far enough into the apple to puncture the skin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
When you reach the core, screw the large blade of the knife
around until the core is sufficiently broken to allow of being cut
away without danger of injuring the apple skin by accidental
stabs.</p>

<p>After most of the inside has been removed turn the apple
around and look at the features; if you cannot yet see daylight
through them, insert the small blade from the outside of the
apple, through each feature in turn, and by degrees cut away
the meat, without enlarging the openings of the different features.
Should this prove ineffectual, again turn to the back of
the apple and work from the inside, removing more of the contents
and making the layer of apple thinner next to the skin.
Then once more try through the features from the outside.
This time the result should be distinctly clear openings for all
the features. You cannot help
smiling when you look at the
apple now, for you see such a
comical little face.</p>

a pin through the centre of the candle from bottom to top; then
pull it out. Fit the candle inside on the centre of the bottom of
the apple, hold it in place while you run the pin up from the
outside of the apple, through the skin and into the pinhole in
the centre of the little candle. The pin should hold the candle
firmly in place; if it does not do so, pull the pin out and see
what is the matter; possibly the candle needs hollowing out a trifle
at the base in order to fit the slight rise in the apple on which the
candle stands. Put on your thinking cap, examine and <i>make</i>
the candle stand absolutely straight and firm.</p>

<p>Manufacture all the other individual pumpkin lanterns in the
same way, and when story-telling time arrives set a lantern in
front of every girl and boy in the circle and light the candle in
each little pumpkin. The effect will be charming and inspiring
for the story-tellers. Oranges with all the pulp extracted also
makes very pumpkin-like lanterns when cut in a similar way
to the apple lanterns (<a href="#Fig_96">Figs. 96</a>  and <a href="#Fig_97">97</a>).</p>

<p>Anything may be given as</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Forfeit</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and the forfeits are redeemed in the good old way. The leader
is blindfolded and seated. A girl or boy stands back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
leader, and, taking one of the forfeits, holds it over her head,
while repeating these words, “Heavy, heavy hangs over your
head.” The leader replies with the question: “Fine or superfine?”
If the forfeit belongs to a girl, the answer is “superfine,”
if to a boy, “fine.” The same player adds, “What shall the
owner do to redeem it?” The leader names a penalty, such as,
kneel to the prettiest, bow to the wittiest, or, look angry, then
smile your sweetest. The leader may inflict one of these, or any
other, making the penalty as funny as she desires, but it must
never cause a player to feel in the least uncomfortable, for every
girl and boy should be given just as good a time as possible, that
all may return to their homes from the Thanksgiving games
happy and pleased with their evening’s fun.</p>

<div class="drop-cap2">THIS entertainment is one that girls can

boys may take part. It is very funny
if well carried out and will give every
one a hearty laugh, which we all know
is a good thing after the Thanksgiving

and to carry out the effect of black and white pictures their
faces and hands should be made perfectly white with chalk,
their eyebrows blackened and black wigs made of fringed tissue

man’s should be long and hang down to his shoulders. A tight
black waist and skirt nearly to her ankles; a long white apron,
white kerchief and cuffs (cut from old muslin) and a tightly
fitting little black cap with a turned over edge of white form the
costume of the woman. With these should be worn low

part.</p>

<p>Before showing her pictures Madam Moselle should stand
in front of the screen and say a few words extolling the pictures
she is about to present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl who represents Madam Moselle should deliver an
amusing little speech, giving a foreigner’s idea of our first Thanksgiving,
and it can be made absurdly funny with its many ludicrous
mistakes.</p>

<p>At the close of her address the lights must be put out and the
scene quickly arranged close to the screen, all the actors except
two being seated at the table. Thus remain two empty chairs.</p>

<p>As quickly as possible the light should be turned on and at
the same time the actors must begin</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Pantomime</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of eating, drinking and talking.</p>

<p>They should express anxiety for the safety of the tardy guests,
some of them leaving the table to appear to look out of a door
or window.</p>

<p>All the while (this is the great point) the actors must shake
and quiver in imitation of the queer trembling and quivering
always seen in the moving pictures; and their movements must
be very rapid.</p>

<p>Soon the missing couple should appear, coming in hurriedly
and by gestures telling of an encounter with the Indians.</p>

<p>Their clothes should be pierced with arrows, and the Puritan’s
hat must be bristling with them.</p>

<p>All this will be very laughable if the acting is good, and
absurd little by-plays introduced; but the whole thing will be
spoiled unless the constant quivering and shaking is kept up by
all of the actors.</p>

<p>The picture can be “flashed off” the screen by simply turning
out the light, and others may be shown giving various incidents
in Puritan life or the early history of our country.</p>

<div class="drop-cap2">THE fun of the Valentine party begins with
the invitations, which are in the shape
of a heart. The message on the outside
(<a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a>) leads to the opening of the

<p>To make the design, fold through the

you will make a small square of
four layers of paper. On one side

sides of the heart; cut these only part way
down as shown by A and A (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>). The

stamp from the box, then open her eyes, read the stamp and on
it sign her name at the right-hand corner, then fasten the stamp
on the valentine with paste given her by the postmaster, and
move onward to give place to the next girl in line.</p>

<p>When all the boys’ valentines have been stamped, the girls
take their seats and the boys form in line and stamp the girls’
valentines in the same manner.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Valentine Stamps</b></p>

<p class="unindent">should be previously prepared. They are made uniform in size
of small squares of white writing paper, on which is written any
kind of a wish which may add to the fun, such as:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I wish you would smile at me.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish you would sing me a song.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish you would tell me a funny story.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish you would sit by my side now.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish you would walk around the room with me.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish you would recite poetry to me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When entering the room each guest is given a card. On one
card is written,</p>

<p class='center'><b>“When the Bell Rings</b></p>

<p class="unindent">once go to the post-office”; on another, “When the bell rings
twice go to the post-office,” and so on, each card designating a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
specified number of rings. The postmaster sounds the bell at
intervals, giving a different number of taps at each ring, until
every girl and boy is supplied with a valentine; then each boy
seeks the girl who has signed the stamp on his valentine and she
asks that the wish be fulfilled. The request is, of course, laughingly
and courteously granted. The valentines being sealed with
St. Valentine’s stamps, the mystery of the sentiment enclosed
cannot be revealed until the wish on the stamp is granted, and
neither the girls nor the boys are aware of the contents of the
valentines they stamp. Later in the evening the girls find the
boys who have signed their stamps, and then, entering into
the spirit of the fun, they grant the boys’ wishes as written on
their stamps.</p>

<p>The guests may bring extra valentines made especially for
and directed to either hostess or guests. These are not sent
through St. Valentine’s post-office. The hostess keeps one door
of the parlor closed for the benefit of those desiring to send
special valentines. A sign posted upon it reads:</p>

<p class='center'>CUPID’S DOOR</p>

<p class="unindent">and quantities of paper flowers with gilded pasteboard hearts,
bows and arrows adorn it, giving it a very festive appearance.
Each guest is at liberty at any time during the evening to slip from
the company, make her way through the hall to Cupid’s door,
slide her valentine under the door, give a quick knock and
scamper off before she is caught. Only the hostess has the
privilege of opening Cupid’s door, and to her belongs the pleasure
of delivering these valentines to the various guests for whom
they are intended.</p>

people, old people, busy people, idle
people, all come flocking to the Wild
West Show when it posts its gay
pictures and spreads its fascinating
white tents for the benefit of the
public.</div>

<p>But did it ever occur to you that
the show could come to you—that
is, you might organize a show of your own and arrange things
to suit yourself? If you want the Wild West Show
first and a circus after you can have them. Should
you prefer both shows at the same time they are
yours, for you can make the entire affair—horses,
riders, Indians, wild animals and tent. You may
do even more—you can cause all the performers
actually to move, and that by the mere turn of your
wrist, because your show will be in reality the moving
pictures of</p>

<p>Get a common old house-broom (<a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>) and
saw the broom part off evenly from the handle at
the dotted line A; then saw two pieces of equal
length from the handle at dotted lines B and C,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

<p>Find or make a wooden
box about twelve inches
high, eighteen inches wide
and eight inches deep; carefully
pry off one of the eighteen-inch
sides and cut two
round holes through the top
of the box, one at each end,
two inches from the front and
one and one-fourth inch from
the end; then turn the box
over and cut corresponding
holes through the bottom;
reverse the box again, bringing
the right side up (<a href="#Fig_118">Fig.
118</a>). The holes on the bottom
must be exactly under
those on the top and all four
holes must be only large
enough to allow the roller to
slip in, and while in, to turn
easily (see <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>). Remove
the rollers and nail a strip of
wood two inches thick across
each end of the bottom of the
box (<a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>). Then hammer
two strong staple-tacks on each roller two and one-half inches
from the top, or smaller end, and on opposite sides of the stick;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

the screw rests on the block of wood; then screw it down tight,

</div>
<p>Purchase two yards of low-priced white cambric dress skirt
lining; fold the cambric lengthwise into three equal divisions;
then cut the folds apart, making three lengths
each two yards long and about eight and one-fourth
inches wide; sew the pieces together along
the end edges, lapping one over the other that
the seam may be as thin and flat as possible
(<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>). This will give you a strip almost six
yards long for the panorama. Do not hem
either the top or bottom. Allow a blank space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of white cloth, sixteen and one-half inches long, at the beginning
of the panorama; then commence</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pasting Pictures</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on the strip. Colored newspaper pictures are best, because
the paper is thin and easily pasted on the cambric. Almost all
leading newspapers publish in their issues from time to time
colored pictures of wild animals, rough riders, Indians and circus
performers.</p>

<p>When you have a collection of the pictures you want, cut each
one out neatly. When all are ready, sort them over, selecting
the one you wish to come first on the panorama; then the second
picture and so on. Have them all in order so you need waste no
time hunting for a print while pasting the pictures on the cambric.</p>

<p>Make a good paste of flour and water, allowing it to boil well
before using. A drop or two of oil of cloves mixed with the paste
after it has cooked will keep it fresh a long time.</p>

<p>Select an attractive, comical picture for the first design on
the panorama; but save the best and most startling picture for
the very last.</p>

<p>You should arrange</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Performers</b></p>

<p class="unindent">in your panorama in much the same way as a story is written or
a play put on the stage. Always begin with something which will
cause the audience to want to see more; then paste on various
pictures, but toward the last lead up to the best and most exciting
design; the last picture stands for the climax in a story or a play.</p>

<p>When placing the pictures on the strip of cambric, remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not to have them close together; keep them apart, allowing a
little blank space between each successive object, so your audience
will have an opportunity of enjoying every one of the performers
and wild animals as it first appears peeping from behind
the roll at one side of the tent, showing only its head, then coming
in full view and passing slowly before them until it finally disappears
around the roll at the other side (<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>When the Pictures Are All Pasted</b></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 126.—Cloth fastened on roller.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">on the strip, turn over and crease down half an inch of cambric
along the edge of the first end of the panorama; tack this end on
one of the rollers. If the thickness of the top of your box is
one-half an inch, tack the end of
your panorama fully four and one-half
inches below the top or smaller
end of the stick. Should the thickness
of the lid be one inch, the
cambric strip must be tacked on
still lower—about five inches from
the top.</p>

<p>You cannot be too particular
about having the edge of the cambric
perfectly even and straight on
the roller, so the strip will lie at a
true right angle to the roller when
laid out flat (<a href="#Fig_126">Fig. 126</a>).</p>

<p>Having tacked the cambric on,
gradually roll it around the stick, keeping the strip running over,
not under the stick, so the roller will stand behind the cambric;
have the cloth perfectly even as it winds around and around.
When the end of the cloth is reached, turn in one-half an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the end edge and tack the cambric to the second roller as you
tacked the beginning on the first roller (<a href="#Fig_127">Fig. 127</a>).</p>

<p>Use the same precaution and wind in the same manner but
in an opposite direction when rolling the cambric on the second
stick. With a strong hammer strike the top or lid of the box
along the edges from underneath until it loosens and can be removed;
take it off and slide the rollers with the attached panorama
into the holes on the bottom of the box (<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>).</p>

<p>Replace the lid of the box, passing the top ends of the rollers
through the holes, and nail the lid down to the sides of the box;
then refit the staple-tacks in their respective places and see that
they are in tight; restore the crank-handles on top of the rollers
and rescrew them in position (<a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>). Now the panorama
is ready to go into</p>

turning the slashed portion over and fastening it on the back of
the pasteboard; then
fasten a curtain on
each side (<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>)
and paste the top piece
of the tent on last;
scallop this along the
bottom edge and paste
it only along the two

of the pasteboard and
paste. When dry, fit
the tent over the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the box and tack it firmly in place. Make three little flags of
gay paper, paste on sticks and glue the sticks to the top peak and
sides of the tent (<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>); paste strips of paper over and
across the flag handle to the pasteboard to hold the flag more
securely on the tent (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>). Your show will then appear to
be moving inside of a white circus tent.</p>

on the second roller, leaving only the blank portion of the cloth

turning the crank-handle of the first roller; at the same time
telling in clear, well enunciated words all about your Wild West
Show. Do not try to have your remarks sound as though learned
from a book; that would be stiff and unnatural.
Talk in an every-day way, exactly as though you
were speaking only to your most intimate friend,
and wanted to tell her all about the strange sights
and queer people, and the funny bears who are
not afraid of any man woman or child.</p>

<p>If you have been to a real Wild West Show,
that will give you ideas, or if you have traveled
way out West and seen the actual Wild West life
it will be an inspiration for your show. Even to
have read about the life with its daring riders, wild
horses, buffaloes, hazardous stage coach drives, Indians and their
war dances will be an immense help in aiding you to enter into
the spirit of the show.</p>

<div class="drop-cap">INVITE your friends to an afternoon picnic, and in
the morning prepare the grounds for the frolic.
Have a lot of growing flowers and growing fruit
to give the place an attractive and festive appearance.
The fruit must be real, not make-believe;
it must be ripe and ready to pick; but the
flowers may be of tissue paper, cheerfully bright
and large in size. The aim should be more for
general effect than detail in making these outdoor
decorations.</div>

Smaller circles, crimped by drawing

pinks, and you may have brilliant,
nodding poppies in the same way,
only these are of smooth, uncrimped
circles (<a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>), placed one inside
the other, with a small circle of dark-green
paper for the centre, and all
three layers pinched together at the
extreme centre (<a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>). Large peonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

<div class="caption">Fig. 142.—Paper rose.</div>
</div>

<p>A simple way to make</p>

<p class='center'><b>Roses</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is to cut tissue paper into strips two and a half inches deep;
cut the square-cornered slashes two inches wide, then with knife
or scissors blade curl the sharp corners
of each separate division, making the
slashes into rose petals. Curl the corners
of the petals along half of the
strip inward, and those along the other
half, outward. Fold two or three plaits
in the straight bottom edge of each
petal; then begin with the half where
the petals curl inward and wind the
strip around the end of a slender stick.
The first petals form the central group
and are curled inward; the remainder,
curled outward, form the outward circle
of petals (<a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>). Make a generous supply of blossoms and
tie them on bushes. Let each bush bear but one kind, that the
flowers may appear natural and as if actually growing.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Get a Variety of Fruit, Peaches, Plums, Apples</b></p>

<p class="unindent">or any other sort you may prefer. Tie the fruit to those bushes
which have no blossoms, allowing each fruit bush to bear only
one kind of fruit.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 143.—Pattern for

</div>

<p>In case there are no bushes, or if the bushes are too few in
number, use branches or sticks with natural foliage, or leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
made of green tissue paper; make the latter of paper in several
layers, that a number may be cut at a time like the pattern (<a href="#Fig_143">Fig.
143</a>). Crimp through the centre by folding
lengthwise over a hat-pin and pushing the
folded centre together (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>). The method
is quick and gives satisfactory leaves
(<a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>). Cut leaves in different sizes as
you will need some larger than others.</p>

<p>The sticks used as bushes should be of
varying heights sharpened at the lower end
and driven into the ground.</p>

<p>Pretend the sticks are fruit trees and
flower bushes and plant them where they
will appear to best advantage.</p>

<p>If your yard happens to be</p>

<p class='center'><b>On the Roof</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of the house, as often occurs
in large cities, there
will probably be no earth in which to plant
things; then you must fill flower pots and
deep boxes with earth, sand, or gravel, and
plant your make-believe trees and shrubs in
them; such a garden will be entirely different
from all others.</p>

<p>Build a wooden fence over which the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and boys climb to enter the picnic grounds; even though the
improvised fence may not closely resemble the real article, it will
help to render the feeling of being in the open country more
realistic.</p>

<p>Make the fence by sinking the legs of two strong kitchen chairs
partially but firmly into the earth. Place the two chairs facing
each other and a short distance apart; then run a large, strong
pole or narrow board for a rail, across the chair seats, allowing
the rail to extend out beyond the back of the chairs. Lash the
rail securely to the chairs with the heaviest twine or slender rope,
and place very heavy weights on the seat to keep the chair steady,
and avoid all possibility of the rail slipping or chairs tipping.</p>

<p>If possible get either a swing, a teeter or a jogging board;
all these will afford a lively time for your guests, as will also a
wheelbarrow in which the girls and boys may take turns in riding
and pushing or wheeling each other.</p>

<p>If you want to make the affair seem just like a regular</p>

<p class='center'><b>Country Picnic</b></p>

<p class="unindent">let each guest bring his or her own little basket of lunch.</p>

<p>As your guests arrive, usher them into the house and do not
let them even see the yard if it can be avoided; keep the grounds
for a pleasant surprise a little later.</p>

<p>Form the girls and boys into a single file and lead them
marching around the room while they join in singing some lively
air. After winding in and out among the chairs and tables, open
the door, let them look out into the pretty garden, and, while still
singing,</p>

<p class='center'><b>Climb Over the Fence</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and march among the flowers and fruit trees; end the procession
by circling around the spot chosen for your dinner table, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
all must deposit their lunch baskets. Of course you will not
have an actual table, as the tablecloth must be spread on the
ground and the girls and boys sit
around it.</p>

<p>Mark the four corners of the
space reserved as a table with sticks
about forty-six inches high, decorated
with bright flowers (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>),
and the sharpened ends planted in
the earth, or in flower pots.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Spread the Tablecloth,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">bringing each corner to meet a garland
pole; then let the guests take
from their baskets the different articles.
Reserve some space at the
centre of the table for fruit, and let
each boy and girl in turn walk
about the grounds and select one
piece of fruit, pick it, bring it to the
table, and lay the chosen piece on
the centre of the tablecloth. No
person may pick more than one
piece of fruit during one turn.
Each player is privileged to place
his fruit in any way he desires, remembering
always that each piece goes to form the centre-piece,
which should always be made as decorative as possible.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Crossing the Brook</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is a lively game and great fun. Get a number of flat stones that
will lie steady, and are large enough to step upon; arrange them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
about eighteen or twenty inches apart, in an irregular line, over
a stretch of ground twenty or more feet across. Let the players
in turn tip-toe on the stones just as though they were crossing
a brook of running water, each girl and boy being obliged to
pay a forfeit for every misstep into the make-believe water. If
stones are not to be had, use blocks of wood, or, if need be,
pieces of paper in place of stones. As each player crosses the
brook, the rest of the party must call to her to be careful, not
to fall, that she is going too fast, that she is going too slow, or
make similar comments. They can cheer her, and in many
harmless ways try to confuse the player with their calls, but it is
against the rules to touch or even go nearer to her than two
yards.</p>

<p>After all the girls and boys have taken their turn at crossing
the brook, try</p>

<p class='center'><b>Japanese Tag</b></p>

<p class="unindent">Each player must keep her hand on the spot where she was last
tagged, making the game present a most laughable appearance,
with all the young people dancing about in strange attitudes,
holding a hand on the top of the head, on the knee, chest, back,
or foot, as it happens. The players are not allowed to remove
the hand until tagged in another spot. When tagged in the
middle of the back or any spot difficult to reach, the player may
hold a stick in his hand with one end resting on the spot where
he was tagged.</p>

<p>In starting</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">any person who first shouts, “Pick her up and stone holder,” may
hold both hands in front of her, each doubled up tight and one
clasping a small stone, immediately some one calls out “First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
knock,” another player cries “Second knock,” another “Third
knock,” and so on, according as they are able to get the call in
after the preceding cry. The player calling</p>

<p class='center'><b>“First Knock”</b></p>

<p class="unindent">taps one hand of the girl or boy holding the stone; if the hand
touched contains the stone, the player knocking is “it,” and the
game begins, but if the hand is empty, the player is free and the
stone-holder puts her hand back of her while she does or does not
change the stone to the other hand; again stretching her clinched
hands forward, she allows the player calling “Second knock” to
try her luck by tapping one of the outstretched hands. The
trials are continued until a player taps the hand holding the stone
and becomes “it,” then</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Others Scatter</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and “it” endeavors to tag some one, who in turn becomes “it,” and
so the game goes on.</p>

<p>After the players have grown tired of this game, there are
many others which will suggest themselves to the young people,
and it will be found a good plan to alternate the livelier kind
with those of a more quiet nature.</p>

<p>When the picnic is over give each guest one of the pretty
paper flowers to carry home, and your roof or back-yard picnic
will have been an event long to be remembered.</p>

</div>

<div class="drop-cap">BRIGHT summer days are the time to be out of
doors in the sweet, fresh air, with the birds
and flowers, where there is plenty of space to
run and have a good time. What a lot of
games can be played in the open. There is
Hide-and-Go-Seek, Catcher, Tag, Hop-Scotch
and many more. You will be able to add a
number to the list. Probably, though, you
have played all of them over and over again, so we will try and
think of something new. We must have a game that will be
lively, interesting, and at the same time require a certain degree
of skill, and the game must be one where we can enjoy the making
of things requisite for the sport; but the material must not cost
more than a few cents.</div>

<p>I have it! A game of flowers with roses that will not wilt or
fade but last for a long time fresh and bright. We will call it
“Plant Your Garden if You Can,” because one cannot always be
absolutely sure of planting the flowers, and that is part of the fun.</p>

flowers are of tissue paper and very pretty.</p>

<p>Cut squares measuring
twelve inches along each of
the four sides, from white, pink,
yellow and red tissue paper;
the dotted lines on the diagrams
indicate where the paper must
be folded (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>). Fold each
square across the centre (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig.
186</a>). Fold again crosswise
through the centre, forming a
small square of four layers
(<a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a>). Again fold, this
time diagonally (A to B, <a href="#Fig_187">Fig.
187</a>), and you will have a triangle (<a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>). Fold once more
diagonally (<a href="#Fig_188">Fig. 188</a>) A to C; this will give <a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a>. Cut
straight across from E to dot D (<a href="#Fig_189">Fig. 189</a>), then cut a slash an
inch and three-quarters deep in the centre of the edges as shown
by the line F in <a href="#Fig_190">Fig. 190</a>. Open out the paper (<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>). The
slashed edges will form the petals of the rose. Curl each corner
edge of every petal with a blade of a pair of scissors according
to dotted lines on the petal (<a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a>).</p>

<p>Begin by holding one corner of one petal between the thumb
of your right hand and one blade of the scissors; gently pull your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a><br /><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
thumb and the scissors blade outward, sliding them along each
side of the petal, while you hold the remainder of the paper
steady with your left hand.
The thumb rubs over the
petal; at the same time the
edge of the scissors blade
scrapes the under side of the
petal, which causes the paper
to curl. <a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a> shows one
petal with both of the side corners
curled. When you have
curled around the first half of the circle, turn the paper over and
curl the petals around the other half of the circle in an opposite
direction. <a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a>
gives two petals
curled forward and
two backward, representing
two petals
on each half of
the tissue-paper
rose. After all the
petals are curled
lay the centre of
the tissue paper
out flat and place
on it three level teaspoonfuls
of flour; then gather up the edges
of the rose and wind a strong thread several times around below
the petals and above the flour-bag formed by the centre
of the paper (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>). Tie the string, adjust the petals and
the rose will be finished (<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>Mark Out Two Flower Beds</b></p>

<p class="unindent">where the roses are to be planted.
Each bed must measure three yards in
length and one yard in width. The
beds must run parallel to each other
and be separated by a space of three
yards. Each of the two flower beds
must then be divided crosswise through
the centre, making four flower beds in
all, two on each side—one for every
player. <a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a> shows the plan with
flower beds divided. The circles denote
the station points or places where
the players stand, and the dotted line
the direction the roses should take
when played by the girl or boy stationed
at the position marked “Barbara.”
The other players send their
roses in like manner over the intervening
space to the flower bed diagonally
across from their position.</p>

<p>That there may be no mistake regarding each particular enclosure
where the different-colored roses should be planted,</p>

<p class='center'><b>Use Flags</b></p>

<p class="unindent">to designate the color of the various flower beds. From inexpensive
cotton cloth of a solid red color cut a flag eighteen inches
long and twelve inches wide; hem the raw edges; then tack one
end of the flag on a slender stick one yard or more in length;
sharpen the free end of the stick and push it down into the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
at the outer back corner of the flower bed intended for the red
roses. Have the flag stand straight and firm. Make a white,
a yellow and a pink flag in the
same way. Erect each in the
outer back corner of its own bed,
which will be the bed where roses
of corresponding color are to be
planted. All the flags must be
of equal height.</p>

</div>

<p>If the game is played at the
seashore on a smooth, hard beach,
mark out the flower beds by running
the end of a stick along in the
sand. If the game takes place on a level lawn, use white tape for
marking the beds; peg the tape down to the earth with common
wooden clothespins (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>), first sliding the tape in the
clothespin (<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>).</p>

</div>

<p class='center'><b>The Four Rackets for the Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are ordinary flat palm-leaf fans, one fan to each player.</p>

<p>The game is played by sides, and calls for four players, two
on each side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is that each player in turn shall plant as many roses in her own
garden as she can. Every player has six roses of one color; the
two holding respectively the white and the red roses are on one
side, while the two with the yellow and the pink roses take the
opposite side. When all is ready and the players are at their
stations, a signal is given and the game begins.</p>

<p>The first player holds one of her roses out with the left hand,
strikes it with the fan-racket held in the right hand, and endeavors
to send the rose flying and land it in her own garden. If she succeeds,
the rose is said to be “planted,” and scores her one point,
but should the rose go beyond the boundary line of her flower
bed, fall short of it, or the flour-bag of the rose be broken, the play
is a “failure” and scores one point for the opposite side. When
a rose falls on the boundary line of its own flower bed, the play
is a “fault,” and the player may try again with the same flower.
After the first player has had her turn, a player on the opposite
side tries her skill, for the turns must alternate from side to side.
The game ends with the playing of the last rose, and the side
scoring the greatest number of points wins the game. All roses
when played must remain where they fall until the close of the
game, with the exception of those falling on the boundary line
of their own beds.</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Tally Card</b></p>

<p class="unindent">will be required for keeping a record of the game. Make one of
white pasteboard (<a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a>). The initials can be changed to
those taking part in the sport. Every point scored must be
written under the color and initial or name of the person who
scores it. When, because of the failure of one player, the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
side scores a point, the score must be recorded in the third
column belonging to that side on the tally card under the word
“Won.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;"><a id="Fig_199"></a>
<img src="images/i_182.jpg" width="264" height="274" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 199.—Tally card.</p></div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>To Determine the Choice of Sides,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">which shall be first, and the distribution of colors, draw straws
for the colors and toss for position of sides. To draw straws,
take four straws of varying lengths, and grasp them in your hand
in such a way that the extending ends of the straws seen by the
other players are the same in length, while the uneven ends are
closed within the hand; allow each player to draw a straw. The
girl or boy taking the longest straw has first choice of colors;
the player holding the straw next in length has second choice,
and so on.</p>

<p>To toss for position of sides means that a player from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
side shall toss a small stone toward a stick laid on the ground
two yards distant from the spot where the players stand. A
twig placed on the spot may mark the point from which the
stones are to be tossed. The stones must be tossed in turn, not
at the same time, and the player whose stone comes nearest to
the mark wins the right for his side to the choice of position on
the grounds, also the right of first play.</p>

<p>One charm of this game is that the roses when volleyed by
the players invariably land on the ground blossom uppermost,
and these twenty-four bright blossoms scattered over the green
lawn or sandy beach, with gay, colored flags outlining the four
corners of the garden court, and, best of all, the group of merry
boys and girls, make a very attractive and pretty scene.</p>

<p>The game, though intended for four players, may also be
played by either two or eight players. When only two take
part, each must play the twelve roses belonging to his side; in
other respects the rules are the same as in a four-handed game.
When there are eight players, four must stand on each side and
each player have three roses, two players necessarily playing the
same color, but not in the same bed, as the garden on both sides
must be divided into four beds that every player may plant roses
in a separate flower bed; otherwise the original rules hold good.</p>

<p>“Plant Your Garden if You Can” may be adapted to the house
when chill Autumn days appear and the weather grows cold and
rainy. When played indoors the beds may be marked out by
white tape as on the green lawn, only in this case wooden clothespins
would be of no use, and thumb tacks, such as are used by
artists, must take their place to fasten the tape down on a bare
wooden floor, and safety-pins when the floor is carpeted.</p>

<small>JOLLY LITTLE SANTA CLAUS
WITH HIS REINDEER AND
SLEIGH</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_185.jpg" width="185" height="249" alt="D" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">DO you want to see—actually see!—Santa
Claus seated in his sleigh
filled with toys, and driving his
famous reindeer? You may do so
and have him come to your home.
Even if there is no chimney and
open fireplace for Santa Claus to
climb through, the blithe little
fellow can be induced to appear,
sleigh and all, and he will keep
his turnout standing perfectly still
that all the family may have a good, long look at him. But you
must carefully follow directions and help Santa Claus get ready
for your Christmas (<a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>).</div>

<p>It would be difficult to say positively how long Santa Claus
has lived, or when he first made his appearance, but we all know
just how he looks,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His eyes twinkle, his dimples are merry,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: .5em;">His cheeks are like roses, his nose like a cherry.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">We know that he is sure to come every Christmas, and the girls
and boys look forward gladly to his visit. The little Hollanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
name our Christmas Saint Santa Claus, the same as we do, though
sometimes we call him Kris Kringle. In England he is both
Santa Claus and St.
Nicholas, in Switzerland
Samiklaus, in
Russia he is St. Nicholas.
But no matter by
what name he may be
called, he is always the same, always the jolly little fellow
bringing good cheer to every one. Santa Claus takes great delight
in driving his tiny reindeer and sleigh full of toys over roofs
of houses for the special benefit of the girls and boys he knows,
and that includes all of them.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 204.—Extensions on each hoof.</div>
</div>

<p>An ordinary sled (<a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a>) will do for the foundation of</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Sleigh,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and a box for the body of the sleigh
(<a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>) to set on the sled (<a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>).
Find some furs to use as robes to
hang over the sides and back of the
sleigh; any kind will do—boas, collars, circulars or rugs. Fit
them in and over the sides of the box. If you have no furs,
try plush or colored
blankets. Tack gay-colored
paper over
those portions of the
box which are not concealed
by the robes,
and lay a small, light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
board over the top front of the box, resting the ends of the board
on the sides of the box to make the seat on the sleigh. Cover
the board with the same paper as that tacked on the box.</p>

<p>Make two</p>

<p class='center'><b>Reindeer</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of stiff pasteboard like <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>. Now, do not think you cannot
make the deer because you may not be skilled in drawing, for
you can do so easily. Take a large sheet of paper and draw on
it an oblong forty-eight inches
wide and thirty-six inches high;
divide the oblong into squares
measuring six inches on each of
the four sides, which will give
eight squares in width and six
squares in height. With the aid
of these squares it will be fun
to copy the reindeer. Number
the side lines of your oblong and
letter the top and bottom lines as in <a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>. Examine the
lower corner space of <a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a> enclosed by the lines A-5, and you
will find the hind hoof and part of the hind leg stretching diagonally
across the space. Use a soft lead-pencil and begin copying
the deer by drawing a slanting fine from the extreme outward
lower corner upward about one-third of the distance from the bottom
to the top of the space A-5. This short slanting line forms
the bottom of the hoof, the little space, enclosed between the hoof
and the long toe above it reaches very nearly to the centre of the
lower part of the square A-5. Make yours so. Draw the upper
edge of the long toe; then run a slanting line up to the top line
of the square space A-5, and make it touch the top line 5 less
than one-quarter the distance from the side line A to the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
line of the same square. Return to the lower part of the
hoof already begun and draw the inside line of the hoof and
portion of the leg in the same space, A-5.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;"><a id="Fig_205"></a>
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="423" height="327" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 205.—Reindeer enlarged enclosed in squares.</div>
</div>

<p>In the space 4-5, immediately above the space A-5, you will
perceive that only a lower corner is drawn in and that all the
four squares above the square 4-5 are vacant, so continue your
drawing on the bottom space A-B. The extreme upper corner
of this is cut off by a short straight line; then a shallow scallop
extends entirely across the upper part and runs into the third
lower space B-C. If you notice closely the space enclosed by
the lines 4-5, A-B, immediately over the one you have been working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on, you will see that the corner on the line 4-A is vacant, while
all three of the other corners are occupied by portions of the hind
leg, and that the empty space extending from the vacant corner
4-A forms almost a square with two lines slightly curved and the
corner diagonally across from the vacant corner 4-A, on the line
4, cut off by a short line bent bow-shaped. Draw it in the same
way over the corresponding
space on your paper. Look
at <a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>, following the line
on the space 4-5, A-B, and
you will discover that it is the
same as in <a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>, only
smaller, and by carefully comparing
the two diagrams, <a href="#Fig_205">Fig.
205</a> and <a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>, you will find
the lines are formed alike in
each, differing only in size;
thus you will understand how
you can make your deer very much larger simply by drawing it
on larger squares. Continue as you have begun, taking one
square space at a time, and copy on your large squares the outline
of the entire deer as given on the squares of <a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 209px;"><a id="Fig_206"></a>
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="209" height="163" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 206.—Reindeer enclosed ready to be
enlarged.</div>
</div>

<p>When the drawing is finished, go over all the pencil lines which
form the deer with black paint or ink, making the lines heavy
and plain, that they may be seen from across the room. As
soon as the paint is absolutely dry erase the pencil-lined squares.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 208px;"><a id="Fig_207"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 207.—Reindeer re-enforced by strip of
wood.</div>
</div>

<p>To make sure that the deer will stand firmly, extend downward
a slanting line from the top of each hoof and draw another
level line out from the bottom of each hoof to meet it, according
to dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>.</p>

<p>Cut out your deer and with pins or thumb-tacks fasten him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
out flat on another large sheet of paper; then with the soft lead-pencil
run a line on the paper around the deer, which will give
you the second deer; outline
the markings on this like those
on the first deer; then cut it out.
If you want six deer for Santa
Claus’ sleigh make them as you
did the second deer. Back
each deer with very heavy, stiff
pasteboard and nail a thin
strip of wood on each of
them. Let the wood reach
from the middle of the head to the edge of the hind leg (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig.
207</a>). Fasten the two animals together with three narrow flat
sticks tacked across from deer to deer, one stick at the centre
and one on each of the two ends of the slanting strips of wood
fastened on each deer. The framework will then rudely resemble
an inclined ladder. Stand the reindeer in front of Santa
Claus’ sleigh and see how fine they look.</p>

<p>To represent</p>

<p class='center'><b>Santa Claus,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">make a large rag doll stuffed with straw or excelsior. It is not
necessary to spend much time on making the doll, as it will be
used only once, and will then be almost entirely covered, showing
only the upper portion of the face for which you can mark
easily with features. Make the boots (<a href="#Fig_208">Fig. 208</a>) like stockings
of black muslin; have them long and loose enough at the
ankle to form wrinkles. The trousers (<a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>) should be of
scarlet cotton flannel, fleece side out; the coat (<a href="#Fig_210">Fig. 210</a>) cut of
the same material; the cap (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>) of the red cloth cut melon
shape, and sewed together. Santa Claus’ costume must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
trimmed with bands of fur. Ermine will look best, and it is
easiest to make. Cut strips of white cotton flannel and mark
them with black ink to represent the little black elongated spots
on real ermine. Trim the tops of the boots (<a href="#Fig_208">Fig. 208</a>), the neck,
sleeves and edge of the coat (<a href="#Fig_210">Fig. 210</a>) and edge of the cap (<a href="#Fig_212">Fig.
212</a>) with fur. Make the wig of raw white cotton, and fasten
it on the doll’s head (<a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>), then the beard, moustache and
eyebrows also of raw cotton (<a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>), and glue them on the
face. Paint Santa Claus’ face pink, his cheeks and the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
his nose bright red, and his eyes blue. When dressing him, bring
the fur-topped boots up over the trousers (<a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>).</p>

<p>With tacks and string fasten Santa Claus in an upright sitting
position on the seat of the sleigh. Tie a long, narrow red ribbon
around the neck of each reindeer and pin or tie the ends of these
ribbon reins on to the mitten-covered ends of the arms which
form his hands. He will then seem to be gayly driving his reindeer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>A LIVING CHRISTMAS TREE</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_195.jpg" width="127" height="152" alt="T" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap2">THIS Christmas tree is not planted in a tub
or fastened to a stand; it does not remain
just where it is put, neither is it attached
to a mechanical device that makes it whirl
and spin around dizzily as they sometimes
do in the shops. It is a living Christmas
tree, a green Christmas tree all covered with
glittering ornaments and bright colored
toys, with little bells at the bottom that tinkle musically as it
moves, and on the topmost point a brilliant star that sends out
tinsel rays from every point. Then, a little distance below the
star, a face—a laughing face with shining eyes that reveal the
guardian angel of the tree.</div>

<p>You can keep the preparation of the living tree absolutely
secret and make it a complete surprise, for it does not have to be
set up where all may see in order to be decorated, and no hint of
its existence need be given until the time arrives, the door is
thrown open and the beautiful, sparkling Christmas tree glides
slowly into the room.</p>

<p class='center'><b>How to Prepare the Living Christmas Tree.</b></p>

<p>Choose quite a tall girl for the angel of the tree and from dark
green, undressed cambric cut a long, plain cloak that will fit
smoothly over her shoulders and hang like an inverted cornucopia
from neck to feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;"><a id="Fig_221"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 221.—Cut the hat after this pattern.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>Make the Peaked Hat</b></p>

<p class="unindent">out of stiff brown paper, cutting it like <a href="#Fig_221">Fig. 221</a>, and pasting it
together like <a href="#Fig_222">Fig. 222</a>. Cover the hat with some of the green
cambric, allowing a cape of
the material to fall from hat
to shoulders at the back (<a href="#Fig_223">Fig.
223</a>). Get three or four quires
of moss-green tissue paper,
cut it into strips six inches
wide and cut each strip into
rather coarse fringe, leaving a
solid strip for heading at the
top, two inches wide. Beginning at the bottom sew the fringe
around the cloak, allowing it to reach just to the edge of the cloth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 125px;"><a id="Fig_222"></a>
<img src="images/i_196b.jpg" width="125" height="179" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 222.—Paste it together
like this.</div>
</div>

<p>Above the first row of fringe, and overlapping it, sew the
second row, bringing its lower edge within
three inches of the bottom edge of the first
row.</p>

<p>In this way put on row after row of
fringe, always overlapping it, until the cloak
is entirely covered, then cover the hat and
its cape in the same manner.</p>

<p>Take a light wooden hoop—one of the
kind the children roll on the pavements in
“hoop time,” and, turning the edge of the
cloak up once, fit the hoop in the fold and
hem the edge over it. This will hold the
cloak out firmly at the bottom and it should hang smooth and
straight from the shoulders with a generous lap where it closes
in front.</p>

<p>Pin the fronts together, leaving an opening only large enough
to slip over the head.</p>

<p>Now suspend the cloak on a waisthanger in such a way that
you can reach it from all sides, and proceed</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Decorate</b></p>

and leave a cape of the
material.</div>
</div>

<p>Around the bottom sew a row of small bells, and here and
there all over the cloak, sew large dress hooks, on which to hang
the fragile glass ornaments and small presents.
Pin on the tinsel decorations and
strings of popcorn with safety pins and
leave the finishing touches until the angel
has entered her tree.</p>

<p>The tall hat, tipped by its bright star,
may be completely trimmed and put safely
away until needed. All decorations and
presents must be light in weight.</p>

<p>On the eventful night let the Christmas
tree angel slip into the tree, and, after it is
nicely adjusted, hang around her neck
strings of colored glass balls, and suspend
from the hooks the glass ornaments and
presents. Put the peaked hat on her head,
and the living Christmas tree will be ready
for her triumphant entry. To avoid the
danger of accident do not allow the tree in a room where there
are unprotected gas lights, candles or open fire, and let the cloak
be put on the angel in a room adjoining the one in which she
is to appear, for going up or down stairs incased in the cloak is
not to be thought of.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>HOW TO GET UP A GIRLS’ FAIR</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_201.jpg" width="149" height="159" alt="L" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">LET two or three young friends help you get up the
fair. Tell them that this is not to be an
ordinary fair, it will be more interesting
and unique; that buyers will find things
which cannot be purchased elsewhere for
any amount of money, as all articles for
sale and even the decorations will be
made by the girls and boys themselves,
and duplicates are not to be found in the stores. Inform the
young people that a prize will be given to the girl and to the boy
whose work is the best.</div>

<p class='center'><b>Form a Managing Committee</b></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 224.—List of promised articles.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and talk over arrangements with them.</p>

<p>If the fair is to be large, you will need either one large room
or several small ones.</p>

<p>When the question of place has been settled to the satisfaction
of all, make out a list of the various girls and boys who will
help with the entertainment, and divide the list into as many
parts as there are young people on your managing committee,
including yourself. Give each member of the committee his or
her portion of the list, with instructions to see every person whose
name is on the paper and find out what each particular one will
promise to make for the fair. Do not confine the soliciting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
young people of your own little circle, ask for contributions from
all the girls and boys your managing committee are able to reach.
Some may want to make several articles each, others may wish to
do the decorating, and so on. Space must be provided on the list
of names for writing down under each
name the articles promised (<a href="#Fig_224">Fig. 224</a>).</p>

<p>Let each contributor understand
that every article sent in must have
the name, age, and address of the
sender written in ink and fastened securely
on each separate article, that
every girl and boy may receive full
credit for what she or he has made
(<a href="#Fig_225">Fig. 225</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the attractive booths
you should have the ever popular
grab-bag and the</p>

<p>Fill the bottom of the tub with large, lightly crushed pieces of
newspaper, cover these with a double layer of smooth paper,
leaving sufficient space at the top for a layer of sawdust, bran or
sand, deep enough to cover the different sized articles intended
for the grab-bag. Each separate article must be wrapped in

black on both sides and, when it is dry, bend up the tail in a
curve. Bend up the neck at dotted line of <a href="#Fig_229">Fig. 229</a>. Pinch together
the beak and bend it downward, bringing the head forward

<p>There must be a handle for lifting the blackbirds; make it
of a hairpin. Bend one end of a wire hairpin into a square hook
(<a href="#Fig_231">Fig. 231</a>) and slide the longer end up through the foremost hole
on the underside of the bird; tie the centre of a string, nine inches
long, on the horizontal bend of the hooked end of the hairpin;
then push the short end of the hook up through the other hole
in the bird, bringing the string up close against the bird’s breast.
Bend the short end of the hairpin down on the bird’s back
and flatten it with a hammer. Curve the top of the hairpin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
into a handle (<a href="#Fig_232">Fig. 232</a>) and fasten the hooked end of the hairpin
more securely to the breast and back of the bird by pasting a
piece of paper over the short portion of the hairpin lying over
the back (<a href="#Fig_233">Fig. 233</a>). Push the paper up tight around the edge
of the wire. Paste another piece of paper over the short length
of hairpin on the bird’s breast in the same manner (<a href="#Fig_234">Fig. 234</a>).</p>

<p>Set the blackbird away until next day, when it will be perfectly
dry, and you will find the hairpin

<p>Tie the two ends of the string
together into a hard knot; then
bend one half of another wire
hairpin into a hook (<a href="#Fig_235">Fig. 235</a>)
and fasten it securely on the string

<p>Instead of making one complete blackbird at a time, it will
be much quicker and easier to make a pattern and cut out all
your blackbirds first; then ink or paint them all, and continue
working on them in this way until
all are finished about the same

once you have the pattern enlarged,

pattern the proper size by the system
of squares, large and small,

<p>Extra packages must be kept in a covered box or basket at
one side, back of the “Blackbird Pie.”</p>

<p>Another original idea for your fair will be</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Express Office</b></p>

<p>At this table each article must be daintily tied up in white paper
and the package labelled with the Christian name of one of the
young people. Wrap up a number of articles that your friends
may find parcels waiting for them when they call at the express
office. The packages should also bear the name of the city from
which they are supposed to have been sent. For instance, if you
have a friend named Mary, and Mary happens to be acquainted
with some young people in Cincinnati, mark the parcel for her
with the name Mary and the place Cincinnati, Ohio. The addition
of the name of some city will add greatly to the interest
and excitement when the package is received.</p>

<p>Though a package may be intended for a certain person,
any one with the same Christian name may purchase the article,
but it cannot be sold to a buyer bearing another Christian name,
and should some one come for an express package and the express
agent be unable to find a parcel labelled with the purchaser’s
name, the would-be buyer must leave the office empty-handed.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of finding a package at the express office
lends a certain charm to this table, for every one will feel some
curiosity to ascertain for a surety whether he or she is included
with the fortunate ones whose names appear upon packages.</p>

<p>Arrange all your articles for the express office in alphabetical
order, those on one side of the table for girls, and on the other
side for boys; then the parcel bearing the name called for may
be quickly handed out to the inquiring purchaser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>Letters to Girls</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and letters to boys are easy to write. Ask as many friends as
possible to write one or more letters to any companions they
choose whom they think will attend the fair. The letters must
be signed by fictitious names, never the writer’s own name or the
name of any real person; then those receiving the missives will
have the sport of trying to find out which of their friends actually
wrote the letters.</p>

<p>Several days before the fair opens all the mail, after being
addressed and sealed, should be sent under additional cover to
you personally.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Post-office</b></p>

<p class="unindent">must be made very attractive, though it need not occupy much
space. A mere corner of the room screened off with dividing
drapery of turkey-red cotton cloth or any gay material will
answer the purpose. Open the drapery at the centre division and
make a three-cornered tent-like window in front between the two
curtains with the aid of a chair. Place a box on the chair reaching
to the top of the chair-back, set the chair between the two
curtains, turn its back toward the people and cover it with the
same material used for the curtains; then pin this drapery to
the curtains on each side.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Decorations</b></p>

<p class="unindent">must be very simple and inexpensive; something which can be
made easily and quickly, and when finished they should be bright
and effective.</p>

<p>Have your decorating committee cut a number of flags from
different colored tissue paper or low priced muslin varying in
length, anywhere from ten to fifteen inches, and in width from five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to nine inches (<a href="#Fig_238">Fig. 238</a> and <a href="#Fig_239">Fig. 239</a>). If the ceiling is very
high the flags may be larger.</p>

</div>

<p>Paste the straight dotted edge of each flag over a strong string
long enough to extend in a graceful loop from the centre of the
ceiling to the side wall (<a href="#Fig_240">Fig. 240</a>). Place the flags about twelve
inches apart on the string and make four strings to reach to the
four corners if the room is small, if large, a dozen or more flag-strings,
according to the size of the room. Have a generous
supply.</p>

strings in place and keep them from slipping down. Tie the
free ends of the flag-strings to picture-hooks and fasten the hooks
on the picture-moulding. In this way you can obtain good results
without the slightest injury to the walls. Should there be no
picture-moulding, fasten the strings to large, strong tacks or small
wire nails driven in on the top ledge of the window and door
frames where they will do no harm.</p>

<p>Fasten extra strings from top of window and door frames, and
draw them taut along the walls, then tie the intervening flag-strings
on these and the effect will be much the same as with
picture-moulding, almost like a tent of small flags.</p>

<p>Hang a long, gay tassel on the wall at the end of each flag-string.
Make the tassels of bright tissue paper. Take the once
folded sheets of the variously-colored tissue paper as they come
from the store, and cut them into long fringe, lengthwise of the
folded sheets (<a href="#Fig_241">Fig. 241</a>), making each separate strand of fringe
not less than one inch wide. Pinch the twenty-inch-length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
fringe together at the top, wind and tie it with a string (<a href="#Fig_242">Fig. 242</a>),
allowing one end of the string to extend out at the top; wind
farther down and tie again to form the head of the tassel four and
one-half inches from the extreme top (<a href="#Fig_243">Fig. 243</a>).</p>

<p>These large tassels tied to picture-hooks by eight or twelve

<p>Decorate the white covering in various ways, making the

<p>The first covering of white gives value to the colors, causing
them to appear even more brilliant than they are in reality, and
it also renders it possible to use much less colored material than
would otherwise be required, in this way lessening the outlay for
decorations. But in order not to tear the muslin sheets while
fastening on the decorations, paste must be used in place of tacks
or pins.</p>

<p>Make the colored material into wide strips cut into points
or fanciful designs and paste the strips at their upper edges
along the top of front and sides of the white covered tables, allowing
the lower edge to hang entirely free, except where pendant
portions are inclined to stand out; these may be fastened in place
with a little paste.</p>

<p>Cut some of the strips about fourteen inches wide; others
wider, a few narrower; and make each strip long enough to reach
around the front and two sides of one table. Lay a brilliant red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

<p>Fold and cut a green strip fourteen inches wide like <a href="#Fig_246">Fig. 246</a>.

<p>You can devise many other decorative designs fully as
attractive as these, and it is well to experiment
with pieces of old newspaper, cutting them into
various designs until you find just what you
think will make good patterns. In this way your
originality is brought out and in a measure
your artistic sense developed.</p>

<p>Select a cheery, happy girl for</p>

<p class='center'><b>Postmaster</b></p>

<p>—one who cannot help giving a bright smile with every letter,
and try to induce her to make some pleasant appropriate remark
when handing out the mail, as this will add much to the enjoyment
of the occasion.</p>

<p>More important though than anything else will be the large,
the small, the useful, the beautiful and the odd articles for sale
made by the girls and boys. There should be a lot of original
valentines, May baskets, Easter-egg novelties, paper fireworks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Hallowe’en games, funny and instructive toys, tiny log cabins,
scenes from Japan, Russia, the Philippines, and many other interesting
things, not forgetting the Punch and Judy shows, the
circus, the seven wonders of the world, and the home-made rugs,
candles and candlesticks.</p>

<p>The post-office entails little or no extra expense and money
taken in for letters will be almost clear gain. Expense incurred
by the entire fair need be but slight and all the proceeds might
be devoted to some charitable purpose.</p>

<p>One of the best of objects for the money obtained by your
fair is the “Fresh Air Fund,” which helps the poor little suffering
city children to a breath of pure fresh air and saves the lives of
many frail girls and boys. Think how glad you can make some
of these young people; then, of all the enjoyment your own companions
will have in getting up the fair, and how proud and happy
your parents and teachers will feel when they see the result of
your work. If a “Fresh Air Fund” does not exist in your locality
there are other methods of using your profits to good ends.
Really there is no telling how much good your fair may accomplish
in many ways.</p>

<small>CAMPING OUT IN YOUR BACK YARD</small></h2>

<div class="drop-cap3">WHO is ready to go out on a camping expedition
to Make-Believe Land?</div>

<p>It is a wild land, full of wild creatures
if you choose to believe in them. Cats
you will probably meet on the trail, and
they are wild ones if you will. Wolves,
too, may prowl around, for what else are Tramp and Nipper,
your own dearly loved dogs, but descendants of the wild wolf.
There will be plenty of sailing, fishing and outdoor sports.
Guides can be secured at headquarters and you will not have
to travel far, for the camping ground is your own back yard.</p>

<p>You must have your</p>

<p class='center'><b>Camping Outfit,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">as all campers do, and it is the proper thing to think, plan and
talk much about this same outfit. As the trip is to be made
overland and you will have no camping wagon, use bags for
carrying the various articles needed in camp. Old flour bags
are just the thing. Into these you can put all your things except
perhaps the camp kettle. The camping party should be supplied
with a tent, a hatchet, a camp kettle, coffee pot, tin plates
and cups, old knives, fork and spoons, a tin pail and dipper
and a tin wash-basin; all these, as well as provisions must be
taken on the journey in true campers’ fashion, for there should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a><br /><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a><br /><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
be no running back from Make-Believe Land to get forgotten
articles. Shawls and blankets to spread on the ground if it
seem too damp will be a welcome addition to the outfit, and the
party should be provided with sharp pocket knives for whittling
stakes and for other needs.</p>

edge on each sheet, which run from the wide hem at the head
to the narrow hem at the foot of the sheet. Tie a tape on each
of the four corners (<a href="#Fig_250">Fig. 250</a>) and tie a tape at
the centre of the ends of the tent sheet-covering.
This will give three tapes on each side of the
tent—six tapes in all (<a href="#Fig_251">Fig. 251</a>).</p>


<p>Make six wooden pegs resembling <a href="#Fig_252">Fig. 252</a>.
You can have them either round, square, three-cornered
or irregular; the only essentials are that
the pegs be strong and large enough to hold the
tent securely. Have a notch cut near the top for
the tape and a point whittled at the bottom that
the peg may be easily driven into the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>


<p>Look about carefully and decide exactly where you want the
tent placed on the clothesline; then hang the crosswise centre
of the covering evenly over the
line. Hold the top ridge centre
in place with clothespins while
you stretch one side out away
from the clothesline, and peg it
to the ground by tying the tapes
around the pegs and pushing
the pegs slantingly into the
ground, with the peg head running
from and the point directed
toward the tent (<a href="#Fig_253">Fig. 253</a>). Remove the clothespins and peg
down the other side of the tent in the same way.</p>

into the ground in a straight line about one foot or more apart,
and the remaining two in a
line with, and two feet from
the first sticks (<a href="#Fig_254">Fig. 254</a>).
Have the sticks stand above
the ground about two feet, or
the height you want the table,
and keep the crotch, or angle
where the two forks separate,
on all the sticks at an equal
height from the ground. Lay
a stick across each pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
forked sticks. Get a piece of board, rest one end on each of the
supports you have just made, and you will have a rustic table,
strong and suitable for any camp (<a href="#Fig_255">Fig. 255</a>). Use wooden
boxes for seats. Select one box for your</p>

<p class='center'><b>Safe or Cupboard</b></p>

<p class="unindent">in which to keep supplies and camping utensils. Fit one or two
shelves, made from a side of another wooden box, in the cupboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Do this by first nailing strips of wood, for cleats, on the
inside of each side of the cupboard at equal distances from the
bottom (<a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>). Slide in the shelves, resting each on two pieces
of wood (<a href="#Fig_257">Fig. 257</a>). Set a lot of lids of tin cans in the cupboard
to serve as camping plates, also a few tin spoons, an old table
knife, a kitchen fork or two, three tin cups, and a smooth, clean,
folded piece of white paper for a tablecloth.</p>

prevent the string from sliding out of place

shorter than the first strip, and sew it on the two-inch bent flap
of the first strip (<a href="#Fig_266">Fig. 266</a>). Score the two ends of the long strip

next to the covered bow, run the pole through the hole down into
the earth until it is well planted in the ground and stands straight

<p>After tying the lengths of twine together, separate the longest
part into three divisions of four strands each (<a href="#Fig_271">Fig. 271</a>). Braid
these strands together in one braid, beginning close to the string
tied around the bunch; continue braiding firmly and tightly for
the distance of two and a half or
three inches (<a href="#Fig_272">Fig. 272</a>), then untie
and remove the string from around
the bunch (<a href="#Fig_273">Fig. 273</a>); bring the two
ends of the braid together, and joining
all the loose strands
into three bunches of
eight strands each,
braid all into one
braid (<a href="#Fig_274">Fig. 274</a>).
When this larger
braid is one inch
long, with another
string tie the loose
ends of it firmly together
close up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>

Wind the stem with an extra string; then tie a hard knot and cut
away the ends of the string (<a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>).</p>

<p>Divide the loose strands into bunches of three strands each,
making eight bunches (<a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>). Pin the stem down to something
stationary and firm; then take three
strands, or one bunch, in each hand, and
pass the first finger of your left hand between
the two bunches; hold it there while
you carry the bunch in your right hand across the bunch in your
left hand; this forms a loop. Do not take your finger out of
the loop until the entire double knot is made. Bring the bunch
from your right hand under and through the loop formed by
the crossing of the bunches; this will give <a href="#Fig_276">Fig. 276</a>. Pull the
strings until the tie is a short distance from the stem; then tie
the same strands again to form a firm knot. <a href="#Fig_277">Fig. 277</a> shows the
method.</p>

<p>Tie together two more bunches, and two more, until all the
bunches have been used and you have made four knots (<a href="#Fig_278">Fig. 278</a>).</p>

<p>Fit the network over your ball (<a href="#Fig_279">Fig. 279</a>), allowing the covering
to remain on the ball while you tie the bunches of strands into
another row of four knots
below the first row. Look

with 2, and so on. The result

<p>Keep the ball in the net

against the bottom of the
ball (<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a> A). Bring together the remaining two bunches,
B and C, and tie them over the knot A. Again tie in a hard,
firm knot; then bind all the strands together by winding with a
separate piece of string. Fasten securely.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the ball to be covered, so that it may have
a strong yet harmless ring at the top, for no metal may be used

On this stick tie a piece of string close to the ground; then sharpen
the end of another short stick and tie the other end of the string

<p>The length of the tether pole you
are to use depends upon your height
and that of your
young friends.
Make the pole
long enough to allow
being planted
sufficiently deep
to be firm and
steady and extend
up above the surface of the ground, vertically,
to the height of about three feet
above your head. Cut a notch near
the top of the pole before erecting it
(<a href="#Fig_285">Fig. 285</a>). Tie one end of a long
string fast around the notch. The
string must be well waxed, twisted
and doubled and waxed again, and it
must reach within two feet of the
ground. Tie the ball on the loose
end of the string and erect your pole
so firmly that it will not even tremble
when you bat the attached ball ever so
vigorously (<a href="#Fig_286">Fig. 286</a>). <a href="#Fig_287">Fig. 287</a> gives
the first step in tying the ball on the
pole string. D is the end attached to
the pole, E is the loose end. Pass E
under D, then around back again over
D and through the loop (<a href="#Fig_288">Fig. 288</a>);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
repeat this stitch over and over, drawing the string very tight
each time. Finish by tying the E end of the string on the D
end in several knots. Examine <a href="#Fig_289">Fig. 289</a>. It will give you the
process of tying, but the knots are drawn loose that you may see
how each is made. Paint a red ring around the pole just above
the height of your head. Make</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Pattern for the Rackets</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of a piece of paper twelve inches long and five and one-half inches
wide; fold the paper lengthwise through the centre and cut according
to curved line in
<a href="#Fig_290">Fig. 290</a>. Open the pattern
and lay it over a shingle,
the handle at the thickest
part; draw a pencil line
around it and carefully
whittle out the racket.
Smooth down the rough
edges with sandpaper (<a href="#Fig_291">Fig.
291</a>). Make a second
racket in the same way.
Now let us thoroughly understand
the meaning of the
divisions of the court before
attempting the game. Inside the ground circle no one shall go,
for it is not allowable at any time during the game to step on, or
within, or reach over the circle line on the ground surrounding
the tether pole. The straight line is used to divide the ground
into two courts, one on each side of the line, making a separate
court for each player.</p>

<p>The cross in each court is intended to mark the spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
a player must stand to “serve” or strike the ball when the game
first begins. The player must stand on the cross of the chosen
court while serving; at other times during the game she may go
any place within her court, but she must stay in her own court on
her own side of the line.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Object of the Game</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is for each player to strike the ball on the end of the string in
such a way as to cause the string with ball attached to wind completely
around the pole above the red band.</p>

<p>The game is intended for two players, and it begins by each
one, in turn, tossing a small stone or piece of wood as near as
possible to the tether pole while standing at a spot, previously
marked, ten feet from the pole. The girl landing a stone nearest
the pole has first turn and choice of courts; the other player must
go in the court on the opposite side and beyond the circle.</p>

<p>The server holds the ball in her hand and, striking it with
her racket, endeavors to send the ball winding around the pole,
but as the ball approaches the other player or opponent, the
opponent tries to stop the progress of the ball with her racket
and send the ball back to wind around the pole in the opposite
direction. As the ball returns toward the first player, a second
time she endeavors to strike it and wind the string her way around
the pole. In this manner the ball is kept going back and forth
between the two players until one player succeeds in winding the
entire string and ball above the red band; this wins the game,
and the girl winning the greatest number of games out of eleven
wins the set.</p>

<p>While playing the game the ball may be struck but once at
a time, no player being allowed to have two or more trials during
one turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The turns shall alternate between the two players.</p>

<p>If a player fails to send the ball into her opponent’s court on
its way around the pole, the failure is called a fault, and the player
making the fault loses her turn. The lost turn goes to the opponent,
who then stands on the cross in her own court and has
a free strike at the ball.</p>

<p>If a player strikes the ball more than once during one turn,
she is guilty of a fault, and loses her next turn. If a player over-steps
the boundary of her own court in any way, she is guilty of a
fault and loses a turn. When the string winds around the handle
of the racket, or winds about the tether pole below the red band,
the player so winding the string commits a fault and loses a turn.</p>

<p>All faults give the opponent a free hit from the cross on her
own court.</p>

<p>When grown-up girls and boys play tether-ball, the pole
must stand nine feet high when erected. The red band on the
pole must be six feet above the ground. The circle on the ground
around the pole must be three feet in diameter. The straight line
dividing the courts must extend ten feet outward from each side
of the pole, making the entire length twenty feet. The ball must
hang, when at rest, two and one-half feet from the ground.</p>

<p>This game may be played by sides, of equal numbers.</p>

<small>THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_241.jpg" width="106" height="180" alt="I" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">IF you could have seen a certain little boy who
lived so long ago that it would make you dizzy
to try to think back to the time when he ran
about playing and learning many things, you
would have thought him a queer looking little
chap. He was not clothed like boys of our day,
and his skin was almost a copper color, resembling
somewhat that of the American Indian.
His name was a very odd one, spelled C-h-e-o-p-s
and pronounced Ke-ops—possibly his comrades
nicknamed him “Key” when they played together
on the sand. He had another name, Khufu, and it is hard
to tell which the boy liked better.</div>

<p class='center'><b>Cheops’s Home</b></p>

<p class="unindent">was in Egypt, where there are more crocodiles than you can
count, and doubtless the little brown fellow, at a safe distance,
enjoyed watching the sleepy creatures while he vaguely wondered
why crocodiles always crawled up on the banks to lie so
long and still in the sun. There were many other strange animals
and queer Egyptian things—unlike any you have ever
seen—that interested and delighted the child. When Khufu
grew to be a man he was</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>A Great Monarch,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">an Egyptian King, and instead of watching crocodiles busied
himself watching and ruling a nation. The King did not bother
greatly about the house he lived in, but spent much energy and
many years in building an enormous pyramid, the largest ever
erected at any time. When you grow older you may possibly
take a trip to Egypt and see this</p>

<p class='center'><b>Wonderful Structure,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">built 900 B.C. It is made of huge stones, most of them thirty feet
long, five feet high and four or five feet wide. How do you suppose
men ever managed to lift such monstrous blocks to build
the pyramid? Well, they were obliged to labor very hard, for
it took two hundred layers of stones for the pile, and all the work
was done with the utmost care and precision.</p>

</div>

<p>You must also use care and precision in building your Egyptian
pyramids. Have them exact, and in place of the heavy
stone blocks use</p>

<p class='center'><b>Coarse Sandpaper</b></p>

<p class="unindent">If possible, get it of a tawny yellow hue, that the miniature pyramids
may be the same color as the originals, now that the outside
casings of the latter are off. King Cheops had an army of one
hundred thousand men laboring constantly during twenty long
years to pile up his stones. You can make your Khufu Pyramid
in twenty minutes and need employ only ten fingers instead of
one hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>Cut one side of</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Pyramid</b></p>

<p class="unindent">from sandpaper (<a href="#Fig_292">Fig. 292</a>); if the paper is not stiff enough,
paste it on a piece of cardboard; an old box-lid will do. Make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
two more sides like the first and gum narrow strips of muslin
along the right side edge of each (<a href="#Fig_293">Fig. 293</a>). The dotted line
shows the edge of the pasteboard underneath the cloth. Join
all the parts together by means of these strips (<a href="#Fig_294">Fig. 294</a>). When
making the fourth side, extend it out into the projection (T, <a href="#Fig_294">Fig.
294</a>) and cut a corresponding slit in the first side (U, <a href="#Fig_294">Fig. 294</a>).
Place the pyramid down flat on a level surface under a weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to dry. When ready remove it and cut off the ends of the strips
(S, V, O, <a href="#Fig_294">Fig. 294</a>); then bend the toy into shape by bringing
the first and fourth sections together and sliding T into U (<a href="#Fig_294">Fig.
294</a>). The pyramid must stand erect and firm as in Fig. 295.
Remember that the four sides of the real pyramid are built
upon</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Perfect Square,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and the base lines of yours should also form a true square. If
you can get some tough paper which will fold together in a flat
crease without breaking, you may make the pyramid of one piece
instead of four, by cutting it the shape of <a href="#Fig_296">Fig. 296</a> and bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
it evenly along the dotted lines to form the four slanting sides.
The loose ends must be fastened together by means of extension
and slit. If you have no regular sandpaper make some. Give
the paper a thin wash of glue, and before it dries sprinkle it
evenly with sand. An old kitchen pepper-box filled with sand
will make a fine sprinkler. If you cannot get the pepper-box,
take a small empty baking-powder can and punch tiny holes in
the cover by hammering a fine wire nail through the tin in many
places; use it as a sprinkler. You must prepare the paper and
have it evenly sanded before cutting out the design.</p>

<p>In Egypt there are three famous structures in addition to
the Sphinx: the great pyramid, the middle-sized pyramid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the little pyramid—like the big bear, the middle-sized bear and
the little wee bear in the story book. Each</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pile of Stones</b></p>

<p class="unindent">was set up by a different king, and each one is named for the
monarch who built it. The largest is called for Cheops; the
second is named Chephren (pronounced Kefren) and the smallest
has the longest name Mycerinus (pronounced Me-ker-in-us).
Make the colossal Cheops as large as the dimensions of your paper
will admit. The original is like a mountain, measuring 746 feet
each side of the square foundation and reaching up 450 feet and
nine inches in height.</p>

<p>King Chephren did not build his stones quite as high; he
was satisfied with a base, each side of which is 690 feet and nine
inches and a height of 447 feet and six inches. The last, King
Mycerinus, must have grown tired of playing with the stone
blocks, for his pyramid is merely a hill 203 feet high, with each

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_257.jpg" width="183" height="180" alt="P" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">PRETEND this is not the twentieth
century, but 288 B.C., and that,
with many other young people, your
home is hundreds of miles away on
a little island in the Mediterranean
Sea called Rhodes. Here
the weather is sunshiny and
bright, and children do not have to
remain indoors because of the rain,
for on this delightful island the sun
comes forth in all its glory nearly
every day during the year. The people think so much of the sun
that they erect statues to it, which they call “sun gods”; they even
have the head of a sun god on one side of their coins, and on the
other side they print a rose, for the citizens of Rhodes are almost
as fond of that flower as they are of the sun. Such quantities of
roses grow on the island that all girls can have as many as they
wish.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 158px;"><a id="Fig_310"></a>
<img src="images/i_258.jpg" width="158" height="303" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 310.—Enlarge this pattern very
carefully.</div>
</div>
<p>Now, we will play that</p>

<p class='center'><b>Your Name is Chares</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of Lindus, that you are a great sculptor and can model all sorts
of wonderful and beautiful objects, and that the city of Rhodes
has commissioned you to make a gigantic bronze statue of Apollo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
their sun god. So you must pretend that you have built two
small islands at the entrance to the port of Rhodes, and that on
each island you have erected immense stone pedestals fifty feet
high, so that your Colossus need not be obliged to stand in the
water. The statue must be made to span the harbor with “legs
wide apart,” as Napoleon stands in the pictures of history.</p>

<p>Apollo must be very large, about one hundred and eleven
feet high, in order that every ship entering the harbor may pass
between the legs of this</p>

<p class='center'><b>Towering Colossus</b></p>

<p class="unindent">as a tribute to the god; and when sailors approach the statue
and pass beneath it they will marvel at the beautiful figure of
polished metal and carry news of it
all over the world.</p>

<p>Make the Colossus of bronze filled
in with stone. Use stiff fine lawn or
fine batiste as the outer bronze covering
of the statue; let the cloth be perfectly
smooth, without a wrinkle.
Take raw cotton batting for the stone
filling. Enlarge very carefully on stiff,
smooth paper the pattern (<a href="#Fig_310">Fig. 310</a>);
make it measure nine and one-fourth
inches from the tip-top line to the
bottom line; then cut it out and lay
the paper pattern down flat over a
double fold of the cloth. With a soft
lead pencil run a line on the cloth
entirely around the figure; be particular
about having all the curves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a><br /><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the figure correct. Baste the two layers of cloth together and
machine-stitch them around the outside edge of the pencil
outline.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;"><a id="Fig_313"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 313.—Your Colossus of Rhodes will look like this.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>Do not Sew the Lines Straight</b></p>

<p class="unindent">where they should curve; remember this and devote the best of
your talents to the work.</p>

<p>Leave a half-inch opening at the shoulder of the upraised
arm A (<a href="#Fig_311">Fig. 311</a>). Pull off a bit of the soft, raw cotton and force
it in at the opening A (<a href="#Fig_311">Fig. 311</a>)
between the front and back of
the figure. With a smooth,
slender, dull-pointed stick push
the cotton well up into one of
the points surrounding the head,
which represent the rays of the
sun. When you have the cotton
in the tip of the point, pack in
another piece and continue to
stuff the point with cotton until
it is filled out firmly. Stuff all
the points and the head in the
same way; then fill the opposite
shoulder and upper part of the
arm which is held down at the
side, and next the uplifted hand
and arm, and the body.</p>

</div>

<p class='center'><b>Begin at the Sole</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of the left foot and stuff the lower half of the partially filled hanging
arm, then the lower part of the body and the entire length
of the leg, and fill in the other leg. Before stuffing the feet take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
two strong, stiff hat-pins and break off the heads. If you bend
the ends in removing the heads, hammer them out straight again;
the pins must be perfectly straight. Very carefully work a pin,
broken end first, up each leg well into the body. The dotted
lines along the legs in <a href="#Fig_311">Fig. 311</a> represent the pins placed inside;
the points of the pins extend not less than an inch and a half
below the feet B, B (<a href="#Fig_311">Fig. 311</a>). C, C (<a href="#Fig_311">Fig. 311</a>) shows the raw
cotton, which has not yet been packed into the feet. Lift the
figure by the two pin points, and if it is firm and stiff finish stuffing
the feet; if it bends when held by the pin points, carefully twist
out the pins and insert them again, adjusting them until they
keep the figure stiffly upright when held by the points.</p>

<p>Sew up all the openings and</p>

<p class='center'><b>Cut Out the Statue,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">then slowly punch open the centre of the divisions between the
rays around the head and the uplifted arm, with the point of
a blade of the scissors. Enlarge each hole by twisting the pointed
end of a penholder around and around until the opening is sufficiently
large. Turn the Colossus over on the other side and
carefully cut away the fringe of cloth that surrounds each opening.
In like manner open the space between the body and the
arm extending down the side.</p>

<p>When stuffing the figure, use the cotton soft; do not roll it
into hard wads, and be careful not to run the end of the stick
through the cloth covering and tear it; the same care must be
taken when inserting the pins up the legs. With thread and
needle stitch an outline between the fingers and around the
lower portion of the raised hand. Filling in the figure with cotton
will give you an idea of the labor your great-grandmothers expended
upon their bedquilts when they stuffed elaborate designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of grapes and vines on the coverings. Such quilts are now highly
valued. Give Apollo an</p>

<p class='center'><b>All-over Coat of Varnish</b></p>

<p class="unindent">When the statue is perfectly dry bronze it with liquid bronze, and
if the small openings by the side of the arms seem partially to
have closed, twist the end of the pen handle
through each one to enlarge the spaces.</p>

</div>

<p>Cut a strip of cloth according to <a href="#Fig_312">Fig. 312</a> for
drapery. Hold one end against the figure at
the side where the arm joins the body and fold
the cloth loosely across the front and around the
back of the figure, bringing the other end of
the drapery forward through the space between
the arm and the body. Fasten it in place with
a pin (<a href="#Fig_313">Fig. 313</a>). Bronze the scarf so that no
portion of unbronzed cloth is visible; then allow
the statue to dry, and with sharp scissors trim off
any little ravellings along the edges of the stitching.
With pen and ink</p>

<p class='center'><b>Mark the Features</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on the face. The chin being held up foreshortens the face; this
means that the position causes the features to look as if they
were closer together than they actually are, and that the eyebrows
are nearer the top of the head, which makes all the features
seem higher than when the chin is held level. Do not forget
this while inking the face. Draw rather high on the forehead
two curved lines for the eyebrows; under these mark two curved
oblongs for the eyes, a curve for the nose, with two elongated
dots for nostrils, a larger curve for the mouth and a little one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a><br /><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for the lower lip. Practise drawing the face on a piece of paper
before attempting to ink it on the bronze head.</p>

<p>Find or make two boxes of heavy cardboard each about two
and a half inches high, an inch and a half wide, and two and a
half inches deep. Open the boxes and give the outside a thin
coating of glue. While the glue is wet sprinkle with sand, and,
when dry, replace the covers and the boxes will be two stone
pedestals for the statue.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Erect Apollo</b></p>

<p class="unindent">upon the stone foundation by pushing the projecting pin points
through the tops of the boxes; work a cork on the end of each
pin point, having the cork large enough to rest
firmly on the bottom of the box after it is attached
to the pin point; then, holding each cork in
place, fasten them in turn to the bottom of the
box by pushing a common pin up through the
bottom of the box into the cork. <a href="#Fig_314">Fig. 314</a> shows
the inside of the sanded box with the point of
the hat-pin firmly planted in the
top of the cork, while the cork is
held securely to the bottom of the
box by means of the pin run into
it from the outside of the box.
Apollo must stand firm; the statue
and foundation boxes should be so
securely fastened together as to
seem made in one piece.</p>

<p>There, the famous Colossus of
Rhodes, one of the renowned Seven
Wonders of the World, is completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and now that you have made the statue you can never
forget it. Pretend that Apollo towers in the air at least one
hundred and fifty feet when on the pedestals. Of course, such
a remarkable piece of sculpture could not be constructed in a
moment’s time, so make-believe that you, the sculptor, Chares,
of Lindus, have been twelve years at work on the wonderful
bronze figure. Get a sheet of blue tissue paper to serve as the
water, stand Apollo on it, and make two or three</p>

<p class='center'><b>Tiny Paper Boats with Masts;</b></p>

<p class="unindent">set them on the water under the bronze statue that the vessels
may be sailing beneath the statue into the harbor of Rhodes
(<a href="#Fig_313">Fig. 313</a>).</p>

<p>When you have erected the Colossus on a table and everything
is ready, invite the girls and boys in to see the work; tell
them all about the statue’s being one of the “Seven Wonders of
the World” and what fun you had making Apollo, and that
you intend to make another of the “Wonders,” which you will
show to them.</p>

<p>Play that the Colossus has stood guard over the harbor of
Rhodes for fifty-six years; then make an earthquake</p>

<p class='center'><b>Tumble it Down</b></p>

<p class="unindent">Double up your hand and give a hard knock on the under side
of the top of the table, exactly beneath the spot on which Apollo
stands. With a little aid of the imagination the noise produced
will sound like the rumbling of an earthquake, and the shock will
cause the earth, or the top of the table, to tremble and quake
violently, and down will fall the Colossus.</p>

<p>Make believe that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Statue is Broken</b></p>

<p class="unindent">in many pieces and that the people of Rhodes allow the fragments
to lie scattered on the ground, for you know that after the real
Colossus had been thrown down, it remained where it had fallen
for many centuries, until the year 656 A.D., when Rhodes was
conquered by the Saracens, who sold many of the pieces of the
bronze sun god to a Jew of Syria Edessa. This man had nine
hundred camels carry the fragments on their backs to Alexandria.</p>

<p>Nearly three centuries after the disaster, Pliny saw the pieces
of the Colossus still lying where it fell: “And even as it lies there
prostrate,” he reports, “it stirs to wonder. Few men can clasp
its thumb with their arms; the fingers alone are greater than
most statues; vast caverns yawn in its shattered limbs; within
one sees blocks of stone by whose weight the builder established
it.”</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Colossus</b></p>

<p class="unindent">cost about $500,000, which was obtained from the sale of the
engines of war presented to the Rhodians by a man named Demetrios
Poliorketes, after they had made him give up the siege
of their city, 303 B.C.</p>

<p>There were several thousand statues in Rhodes but none
so large as the Colossus, which is said to have weighed 720,900
pounds. The famous Laocoön and the Farnese Bull were both
modelled in Rhodes. In Roman time Rhodes was thought the
fairest city in the world and is described by historians as superior
to all other cities of its era, for the beauty and convenience of
its ports, streets, walls and public edifices, all of which were profusely
adorned with works of art. Among the students in its
university were Brutus, Cassius, Cæsar and Cicero, and the first
Greek grammar, the one which became the model of Greek and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Latin grammars, was written in this city, so you find that Rhodes
has played a very important part in the world. But the island of
Rhodes is no more a powerful state; it is now a possession of
Turkey, and is ruled by a pasha, who holds office for life, governing
also the adjoining islands belonging to Turkey, and collects
the revenues. We will have interesting news from time to time
from this same island, for one of the newspapers has stated that
a Danish scientific expedition will go to discover all that remains
of the Colossus of Rhodes. You must be on the lookout, therefore,
to know how much they find of the statue and how the
pieces look; then you will wish to compare your Colossus of
Rhodes with the facts stated and any pictures which may be published
on the subject to see how closely your Apollo resembles the
original “Wonder” of the world.</p>

<div class="drop-cap2">PLAY that you are Sostratus of Cnidus, a great
architect, and that you live in the city of
Alexandria, on the coast of Egypt. Here
there is a King called Ptolemy, who desires
you to erect a building different from any
ever known; he wants something grand,
original and unique, an immense structure
adapted to an entirely new purpose. You must make it of white
stone and do your very best, for you are to have the honor of
building the “Pharos of Alexandria,”</div>

<p class='center'><b>The First Lighthouse Ever Known</b></p>

<p class="unindent">Think what that means: When it is finished the people from
other countries will see your Pharos and wonder why it never
occurred to them to build a lighthouse, and they will hurry to erect
similar structures on their coasts, that sailors on all the seas may
have guides in times of danger and not be dependent upon bonfires
burning at the entrances of harbors. These chance watch-fires
are now the only kind of lighthouses the people have, so get
ready your material and make preparations for building, that
you may help the poor sailors. Remember, though, that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
living in the third century B.C., and that we are not in the United
States but on the island of Pharos.</p>

<p class="unindent">It happens that your lighthouse will be on an island in the identical
Mediterranean Sea in which the Colossus was reared, only
not on the same side of the water. The island of Pharos has a
neck of land, built by men, which stretches through the water
to the city of Alexandria, making it easy to go back and forth
for building material. You must have plenty of ground space
for your new style of beacon-light, because the foundation is to
be very large, about six hundred feet square, and the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a><br /><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
will be many stories, growing smaller and smaller in size as the
stories extend upward. The lighthouse must be five hundred
feet high, that the light may be seen miles out at sea.</p>

<a href="#Fig_324">324</a> are given to show the relative sizes of the four stories when
the paper is cut and
laid out flat; the diagrams
are also intended
to explain the cutting
of the slits on the centre
squares. Notice
that in the first story
(<a href="#Fig_321">Fig. 321</a>), as in the
additional three stories,
neither of the ends of
the left-hand slit reaches
to the edge of the
square, while the right-hand slit (H H, <a href="#Fig_321">Fig. 321</a>) touches at one
edge. In the second story (<a href="#Fig_322">Fig. 322</a>) the right-hand slit not only
runs to the edge of the square, but
there turns at right angles and extends
through the edge of the paper
(G G). The right-hand slit of the
third story (<a href="#Fig_323">Fig. 323</a>) differs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
other two; it runs within a short distance of the edge of the
square, where it turns at right angles, making a straight line
to the adjoining side of the square, there turning again at a
sharp angle; the slit reaches entirely through the edge of the
paper H, H (<a href="#Fig_323">Fig. 323</a>). In the fourth story (<a href="#Fig_324">Fig. 324</a>) the slits
are cut like those in the
first story I, I (<a href="#Fig_324">Fig. 324</a>),
being the long slit. <a href="#Fig_325">Fig.

the fifth story, which is
the top one.</p>

four sides to allow the

into the dark night. The
centre of the diagram (<a href="#Fig_325">Fig.
325</a>) is one inch square; two of the sides have slits cut near each
side edge of the windows; on the other sides of the squares are
extending flaps. Cut all the heavy lines, and bend inward and
crease all the dotted lines, then put the top
story together in proper form by sliding the
four side edge flaps through the slits, which
will bring the edges of the sides together, forming
the four corners of the room. Bend back
and crease down the portion of the flaps which
extend inside of the room; do this to make the
fastenings secure. Use strips of bright-red
and orange-colored tissue paper cut into fringe on one edge and
twisted together into a bunch, as in <a href="#Fig_326">Fig. 326</a>, for the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

harbor.</p>

<p>Having fuel for the make-believe fire, and white stone, or
paper, cut ready for building, your lighthouse may be erected
in a few moments. Pierce a small hole in
the exact centre of <a href="#Fig_324">Fig. 324</a> C, and bend
down the sides, allowing the side flap of
each to extend around the corner and on
the outside of the adjoining side. Slip the
end of each flap through the slit which it
covers, shown by B, <a href="#Fig_315">Fig. 315</a>, and bend
back the end that comes through on the
inside; fit the end of the fire (<a href="#Fig_326">Fig. 326</a>)
tightly into the hole C on the top of <a href="#Fig_324">Fig.
324</a> and the work will resemble <a href="#Fig_327">Fig. 327</a>.
Through the two slits on each side of the
fire slide the two bottom flaps of the fifth
or top story; flatten the ends of the flaps up tight to the under
side of the top of the fourth story. Be sure to keep the front
side of each succeeding story directly under the front side of the
one over it, that the steps may fit in place. Fasten each lower
story to the one above in the same way that you attached the
fourth to the fifth.</p>

<p>When the Pharos is finished make the three flights of</p>

<p class='center'><b>White Marble Steps</b></p>

<p class="unindent">leading to the top of the lighthouse. Cut the top flight (<a href="#Fig_328">Fig. 328</a>)

four and one-half inches in length, including the top landing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The side extension K of the landing should be three-quarters
of an inch long. Fold the flat, straight strip of paper back and
forth many times, in fan fashion and crease firmly to form steps
(<a href="#Fig_329">Fig. 329</a>). Slip the extension K into the slit I on the right-hand
side of the top of the fourth story, and slide the bottom of the
stairs into the slit H on the left-hand edge of the third story.
Make the next flight of steps like the top ones, only longer—five
and one-half inches in length before being creased. Place the
end of the platform extension over the bottom of the top flight;
run it through the slit H which turns at right angles from the
edge and fasten the bottom of the steps in the right-hand slit
edge (G) of the second story. Attach the third flight of marble
steps diagonally across the second story in the same manner.
The paper strip for these last should measure when flat seven
inches in length.</p>

<p>The real Sostratus of Cnidus had a</p>

<p class='center'><b>Natural Island</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on which to erect his lighthouse, but you may have the fun of
making one for your Pharos. Find a box a little larger than
the lighthouse and cover it loosely with any kind of stiff cloth;
have the cloth smooth and tight only over the space on which
the Pharos is to stand. On all the other portions of the box the
covering should be irregularly placed, so that it will jut out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
places; fold in others and have as much the appearance of an
immense rough rock as possible. If the box is of pasteboard,
sew the cover on with a stitch here and there; if of wood, tack
the cover on. When ready glue or</p>


<p class='center'><b>Tack the Island</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on a foundation of wood or one of heavy pasteboard covered
with sea-blue cloth or paper to represent the waters of the Mediterranean
Sea; give the island a very light coat of
varnish or glue, except the central space reserved
for the lighthouse. Be careful not to allow the
glue to dampen the cloth sufficiently to make it limp.
While the glue is moist, sprinkle generously with
sand. When dry, glue on the Pharos. Turn inward
the down-hanging bottom flaps and glue them
down securely to the stone. Draw the statue (<a href="#Fig_330">Fig.
330</a>) on white paper and cut it out. Then cut a slip
up through the centre of its stand, bend the stand
at the dotted line, one half of it forward, the other
half backward, and paste the statue upright on top
of the building.</p>

<p>If you would like to do just as the real architect Sostratus
did, write your name in this way:</p>

<p class='center'>SOSTRATUS OF CNIDUS TO THE RESCUING<br />
GODS, FOR THE BENEFIT OF SAILORS</p>

<p class="unindent">on one side of the first story of the Pharos; then paint over it
with white paint so that the name cannot be seen. After the
paint has dried, write over the white paint, “King Ptolemy.”
Sostratus of old carved his name deep on the stone wall of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
building, then plastered over it and set the King’s name in the
plaster. Instead of the plaster you have used paint.</p>

<p>Now place the Pharos in the bright sunlight; let it stand between
you and the light, with the corners of one of the front edges
toward you, and see how well it appears, and how closely the
colored tissue resembles real fire burning and shining brightly
from the top openings. Make tiny paper boats, not over an
inch in length, with wee paper sails, and scatter them on the
make-believe water. The contrast in size of the Pharos and
boats will give a faint idea of the huge proportions of the lighthouse.
Call in</p>

<p class='center'><b>Your Friends</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and let them enjoy the lighthouse with you; tell them they must
pretend that the structure is gigantic in size, that the laborers
were paid only twenty cents a day, and even with such low wages,
the Pharos cost over a million dollars. Explain to them how all
lighthouses of the Roman world were named Pharos, after your
building, because yours was the first and marks an epoch in the
world’s history. Say to the boys and girls that this white building
you are showing them is one of the Seven Wonders of the
World, and beside being very beautiful, it is one of the most useful
of all the “Seven Wonders.” You must make believe that your
Pharos was completed in the year 282 B.C., and remained standing
sixteen centuries.</p>

white pasteboard, similar to the Egyptian pyramid, but let this
one have a flat top. Fasten the pyramid on top of the ceiling
and paste four paper horses with chariot and driver on a small
box on top of the pyramid. Glue the structure on a board and
make two small boxes for each ground corner. Fasten these in
place and paste a paper horse with rider on top of each box, then
your Mausoleum will be finished (<a href="#Fig_331">Fig. 331</a>). The building should
be white. The original was a monument in memory of Mausolos,

idea of the immense size of the statue, place a one-inch doll in
front of the throne, glue a bit of drapery on it, and let the doll
represent a worshipper at the shrine of Zeus. Play that the
ivory, gold and ebony throne is glittering with
precious stones and golden pictures from the
stories of the gods, and that the arms of the
throne are supported by two sphinxes.</p>


<p>The real statue was in the chief temple of
Olympia in Greece, where the Olympic games
were held every fourth year, and Zeus was so
large, it was said, that</p>

<p class='center'><b>Should He Rise from His Throne</b></p>

<p class="unindent">he would lift the roof off the building; also,
that the statue was the supreme masterpiece
of art. Everyone was anxious to see it. The
people believed that should one stand before
the figure and gaze upon it, he would immediately
forget all worry and care. Possibly this charm may be
transmitted to your little Zeus. The next time you are worried,
try it, and see if you do not find yourself smiling as you contemplate
the little statues.</p>

<p>You might let your young friends come to see your Zeus for
four successive days and play that each day is a century, because
for four centuries the real Zeus attracted crowds of people, as it
was held a calamity to die without having seen Zeus of Olympia.</p>

</div>

<div class="drop-cap2">MANY white marble columns, twenty-eight in all,
will be needed for Diana’s Temple, but the
columns are so easy to make, that you will think
it fun and wish more were required. Use stiff
white paper, pretending it is marble, and cut
all the columns according to <a href="#Fig_348">Fig. 348</a>. Keep
strictly to the given dimensions, being careful
to cut each column exact and true and perfectly even. Slash
up the bottom and roll the entire column on a long pencil to
make it curve, then take it off and spread strong glue or paste
along the marked edge and wrap the column around a smooth,
straight stick two inches in circumference, lapping the unmarked
lengthwise edge over the glue-covered edge of the column. Press
the edges together until they cling tight, then remove the column;
bend out the slashed bottom and roll the two top extensions
as in <a href="#Fig_349">Fig. 349</a>. Now</div>

<p class='center'><b>Look at Your Column;</b></p>

<p class="unindent">see how gracefully the capital curves into a roll on each side, reminding
one of a blossom on the end of a stem. The column
you have made is called Ionic, and when you examine the columns
or pillars of buildings, you will easily recognize those with
Ionic capitals. It was principally because of the beautiful rolled
capitals crowning its columns that the temple of Diana was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
known as one of the Wonders of the World, for it was the first
structure that utilized this beautiful style of architecture.</p>

<p>Find a piece of extra stiff white cardboard, nineteen by eleven
inches, and on it draw</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Ground Plan</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of your temple (<a href="#Fig_350">Fig. 350</a>). The distance from the outside edge
of one ladder-like strip to the outside edge of the other is nine
inches. The strips are each sixteen inches long, two inches
wide and divided into six spaces. Make the spaces by folding
a sixteen-inch strip of paper exactly crosswise through the centre,
then folding each half of the paper three times. Place this strip
along the edge of the sixteen-inch lines on the ground plan and
mark the spaces. Draw the oblong for the cella on the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_350">Fig. 350</a>). Make it four inches wide and ten and one-half
inches long, leaving half an inch space between this oblong and
the inner sides of the ladder-like
strips. Take one column at a time
and glue the slashed portion firmly
on the ladder-like strip. Begin at
A, <a href="#Fig_350">Fig. 350</a>, and</p>

<p class='center'><b>Erect the Outer Row of Columns,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">allowing each column to stand immediately

exact centre over the short cross-line,
as in <a href="#Fig_351">Fig. 351</a> (circles indicate
columns). Each column must
stand erect and plumb. Place the
next row of columns just within the
long inner line as in <a href="#Fig_352">Fig. 352</a>. In
the same way erect the second
double-columned row on the opposite side of the foundation
and glue together the sides of the rolled capitals which touch at
the top of each pair of pillars on both rows.</p>

Cut paper for the right-hand section of front steps nine and one-half

Make the two sections for back steps the same.</p>

<p>Cut the right-hand side steps in sections thirteen by six
inches, and twelve and one-half by six inches. Make the other
side sections the same.</p>

<p>Now be very careful in your measurements. If your measurements
are not exact your steps will not fit together. Divide each
section of paper lengthwise from side to side into half-inch spaces
by drawing twelve lines across, beginning half an inch from the
top of the paper. This will make thirteen spaces (<a href="#Fig_357">Fig. 357</a>)
which, when creased backward and forward, fan fashion, will
form seven steps, counting top and bottom landings or treads.
Take the longest section of the front steps and square off one
end with lines half an inch apart and of varying lengths running
down across the first line (<a href="#Fig_357">Fig. 357</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>Begin at the Top</b></p>

squares marked D D D D D D in <a href="#Fig_358">Fig. 358</a> as shown by
heavy line in <a href="#Fig_359">Fig. 359</a>. This makes the corner of the stairs.

<small>HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON</small></h2>


<div>

</div>

<div class="drop-cap">MAKE believe that you are in a singular
place; the city is square, filled with square
lots, on which are square houses, built of
square bricks, and, strangest of all, by the
side of the king’s magnificent square palace
there stands a wonderful garden. The
garden is also built square in four mighty
steps or platforms, one above the other,
each supported by arches.</div>

<p>These are the famous Hanging Gardens and you are in the
ancient city of Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar is king, and the
time is about the year 580 B.C.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The King’s Wife, Amytis,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">used to live in the mountainous country of Media, and when she
married and came to Babylon, she longed for the sight of a hill,
so her husband, King Nebuchadnezzar, had the Hanging Gardens
built for her. Pretend that</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 364.—Cut a piece of pasteboard exactly
square.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>The Queen Has Invited You</b></p>

<p class="unindent">to explore the gardens with her. Up, up the many flights of
marble steps you go to the tip-top of the beautiful hill, and standing
there by her side you have a splendid view of the surrounding
flat country as well as of the River Euphrates, which divides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
city into two equal parts, half on the east and half on the west
side of the river. The Gardens are built as high as the walls
of the city (three hundred feet)
so you can readily look over
the walls to the stretch of land
on all sides.</p>

<p>If you will find some very</p>

<p class='center'><b>Stiff Pasteboard</b></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 365.—Mark it off like this.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">we can go to work immediately
and build toy Hanging Gardens.
Cut a piece of the pasteboard
exactly square, measuring
on each of the four sides
eighteen and one-half inches
(<a href="#Fig_364">Fig. 364</a>). Of this we will
make a box-like foundation. Draw a straight line three inches
from each edge, as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig_365">Fig. 365</a>. Take
each line in turn and, placing the edge of a straight ruler along
it, score the line; that means,
run the knife-blade along the
pencil line at the edge of the
ruler, cutting the pasteboard
only partially through. As
each line is scored, raise the
pasteboard and bend it <i>away</i>
from you along the scored line,
then allow the pasteboard to
lie out flat again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;"><a id="Fig_366"></a>
<img src="images/i_307.jpg" width="211" height="199" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 366.—Cut like this.</div>
</div>

<p>After all the lines are properly
scored, cut the lines A A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and B B (<a href="#Fig_365">Fig. 365</a>) only far
enough inward to meet the
lines C C and D D (<a href="#Fig_365">Fig. 365</a>).
Allowing a scant half-inch extension
at each corner on the
lines C C and D D, cut the
corners out as in <a href="#Fig_366">Fig. 366</a>.
Bend the four little extensions,
then the sides E and
F (<a href="#Fig_366">Fig. 366</a>). Cover the extensions
with strong glue and,
bending the remaining sides
G and H (<a href="#Fig_366">Fig. 366</a>), glue the extensions, one at a time, securely
on these sides.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Hold Each Extension Tight</b></p>

<p class="unindent">to the side until it sticks fast. In this way the cardboard will be
made into a large, square box, which, when perfectly dry, must
have openings cut through all the sides that it may resemble
closely the foundation platform of the real Hanging Gardens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;"><a id="Fig_367"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 367.—To make the twelve openings.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>To Make the Twelve Openings</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on each of the sides of the foundation platform, cut a strip of
cardboard twelve and one-half inches long, and three inches
wide. Across the entire length of the strip draw lines half an
inch apart, as I I (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>). Cross these short lines by a long
line running lengthwise one inch from the top edge, J J (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>).
Between this line and the upper edge draw another line, running
lengthwise, a quarter of an inch from the line J J, as K K, <a href="#Fig_367">Fig.
367</a>. You now have a strip of cardboard twelve and one-half
inches long and three inches wide. Across its entire length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
you have run two long lines, and across the entire width many
short lines.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Begin with the Second Division</b></p>

<p class="unindent">from one end of the strip marked by the short lines, and make
a dot on the centre of the line K K (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>) where this line
crosses the second division. L (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>) shows the dot.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 368.—Stand the box on one side.</div>
</div>

<p>The diagram <a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a> is merely intended as a guide, giving
only portions of the twelve and one-half inch strip you are making.
Begin at the lower corner of the small division under L
(<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>) and draw a curved line up to L; draw another curved
line from the opposite corner of the same division up to the same
point. The two lines will</p>

<p class='center'><b>Form an Arch</b></p>

<p class="unindent">as in M (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>). Skip one division and draw another arch
on the fourth division in the same way that you drew the arch
of the second division. In like manner draw an arch in the
space between the lines K K and J J of every other division on
the strip. This will make twelve arched divisions, leaving a
solid division or pillar at each end of the strip and also between
each opening. With the point of your knife-blade</p>

<p class='center'><b>Pierce Holes</b></p>

<p class="unindent">around the edge of all the arches as shown by the arch N (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig.
367</a>); then with scissors cut the two sides of the second division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
up to the arch and, holding the cut piece with your thumb and
first finger, bend it backward and forward until it breaks away
from the strip, leaving an arched opening. Smooth the rough
edge of the arch by cutting away the uneven particles. Cut all
arches in like manner O O (<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>) and cut the least bit from
across each end of your strip—not more than a sixteenth of an
inch—that the strip may slide inside of the box foundation.
The strip will be a guide in making all of the arches of your
Garden.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Stand the Box on One Side</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and slip the strip inside of it; lay the strip down flat on top of
the lower side of the box (<a href="#Fig_368">Fig. 368</a>) and, holding it firmly in place,
mark the divisions and arches
on the box by running a pencil
line around the edge of each
opening arch of the strip.
Remove the strip, and one
side of the foundation will
be marked ready for the
twelve archways to be cut
out. Repeat the markings on
each of the four sides of the
box foundation, cut open the
archways as you cut those in
the strip and you will have
made a garden foundation like the first story of <a href="#Fig_369">Fig. 369</a>.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Babylonians</b></p>

<p class="unindent">used arches to support their enormously heavy structures because
arches are the strongest kind of foundations. Make another
box of a perfect square of pasteboard measuring thirteen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
one-half inches on each of the four sides, to form the second platform.
Mark off the two and one-half inch sides and your box
will be eight and one-half inches square, with a height of two and
one-half inches. After the glue of this is thoroughly dry, cut
the arches. Use the same strip for a guide that did duty for the
first platform arches. Cut four arches from one end of the strip
and shave off the outside edge of the solid fifth division which
forms the end of the strip where the portion has been taken off.
The strip will now</p>

<p class='center'><b>Fit in the Second Box Platform.</b></p>

<p>When this is all complete, make a third box still smaller, of
pasteboard nine and one-half inches square. Measure off a
two-inch border on every side to form the sides of the platform.
The box should be five and one-half inches square and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
inches high. Cut arches in this platform with the aid of the
same guiding strip of open archways after first cutting off three
additional openings to make it fit the new box. You can also
trim off the bottom of the pillars along the lengthwise lower edge
of the strip that it may be narrow enough to fit more perfectly
in the third platform.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;"><a id="Fig_369"></a>
<img src="images/i_310.jpg" width="409" height="252" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 369.—Foundation of the Hanging Garden.</div>
</div>

<p>Make the fourth and</p>

<p class='center'><b>Last Platform</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of pasteboard six inches square. When finished let the box
measure three and one-half inches square and one and one-quarter
inch high. Two more openings must be cut from your
arched strip to shorten it sufficiently to fit in the last box platform,
for this platform must also be cut into open arches. Build
up the four platforms one on top of the other, as in <a href="#Fig_369">Fig. 369</a>.</p>

<p>Place the centre of each platform exactly over the centre of
the one beneath it.</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Find the Centre</b></p>

<p class="unindent">take each platform in turn and lay a ruler very lightly on its top
that no pressure may bend the arched sides; draw a pencil line
across from the upper right-hand corner to the lower left-hand
corner P, Q (<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>); cross this line with another drawn diagonally
across the square from the other two corners R, S (<a href="#Fig_371">Fig. 371</a>).
The exact centre of the square top of the platform is at the dot
T (<a href="#Fig_371">Fig. 371</a>), where the two lines meet and cross each other.
Find the centre of each platform and very carefully puncture a
hole through the centre with a coarse darning needle. You will
have use for these centre marks when fastening the platforms
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>The Four Different Floors</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of the original Gardens were supported by pillars and arches,
as you have made yours, only the real platforms had more pillars
under them. Between the pillars which formed the square of
the first lower platform twelve arched passageways ran, entering
from each of the four sides and dividing the ground beneath,
equally between pillars and passages. There were rows and
rows of pillars and arches that gave the effect of a honeycomb
with open-sided cells. The arches proper were formed at the
top of the many pillars which supported them, and all were built
of the</p>

<p class='center'><b>Queer Square Bricks</b></p>

<p class="unindent">which had the king’s name stamped on them, with other writing
in a square bounded centre. The bricks were twelve inches
long, twelve inches wide, and three inches thick and looked like
<a href="#Fig_372">Fig. 372</a>. You must pretend that your pasteboard pillars between
each opening are made of just such bricks and that there
are many, many more brick pillars throughout the entire space
beneath the floors.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Cut Light-Green Tissue Paper</b></p>

<p class="unindent">into strips wide enough to extend a trifle over the edge of the
platforms while reaching in across the top far enough to have
the inner edge of the strip covered by the platform resting over
it. The tissue paper should form a flat green band bordering
the entire top ledge of the first three platforms.</p>

<p>Cover the entire top of the fourth and last platform with the
green tissue paper.</p>

<p>Before you can</p>

<p class='center'><b>Plant the Shrubs and Trees</b></p>

<p class="unindent">you must dig holes in the earth for their roots. Take each platform
in turn and, with a coarse darning needle, puncture holes
entirely through both green paper and pasteboard. Let the
holes be in straight rows; make them on the projection or step
of each platform, midway between the extreme edge and the
walls of the next higher story. On the first, second and third
platforms the holes should be an inch and a half apart. Pierce
three holes through the top of the fourth platform, one at the
back on the extreme left-hand corner and one on each side of
that hole, but much nearer the centre.</p>

<p class='center'><b>You Will Need Ground</b></p>

<p class="unindent">upon which to erect your Hanging Gardens. Get a piece of
heavy, stiff pasteboard which will not bend, or a light board
about seventeen inches wide and nineteen inches long. Cover it
with green blotting paper, allowing the paper to extend over all
the edges. Paste the four turned-over portions of green paper
on the under side of the board or ground.</p>

<p>Now build up the Gardens. First</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>Stick a Long Hat-Pin</b></p>

<p class="unindent">through the centre of the fourth or top platform. Then run the
hat-pin through the centre of the third platform; slide this up
next to the top platform, keeping the sides straight and parallel.
Add the second and the first platforms to the others, running the
pin each time through the centre of the top of the platform.
Place the structure on the ground with one of its sides flush with—that
is—along the edge of the ground, and its adjoining side two
inches from the adjoining edge of the ground, leaving about five
inches of ground in front and four inches of ground at the other
side of the Gardens. Then stick the hat-pin firmly down into
the ground and leave it there until the structure is all glued together.
In fitting the building on the ground be certain that it
is turned so that the back of the top platform on which you have
pierced the hole at the extreme left-hand corner lies along the
back edge of the ground O (<a href="#Fig_373">Fig. 373</a>).</p>

long and a scant half-inch wide; fold each strip crosswise through
the centre; then, paste half of one strip on the fourth platform
upward from the right-hand lower corner; bring the free half of
the strip out flat on top of the next platform, which extends immediately
beneath it, and gum down securely (<a href="#Fig_374">Fig. 374</a>). Bind
the other three lower corners of the top platform down to the top
of the next platform in the same manner; then fasten the third
to the second and the second to the first platform, also the first
platform to the ground. When the paste is perfectly dry, cautiously
remove the hat-pin.</p>

C, C (<a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>) must be four and one-eighth inches long
and an inch and one-eighth wide. The height of the side of the
stairs D, D (<a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>) is three inches. The length of the bottom of

the side of the stairs D, F (<a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>) is one inch, and the width
of the back, one and one-eighth inch; this should be the same
width as the stairs C, C (<a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>) because it is intended to fit on

<div class="drop-cap">WREATHES of the spiked leaf
holly, branches of white berried
mistletoe and yards of
evergreen rope can be made
of tissue paper to look so
natural it is difficult to
believe Mother Nature did
not provide the material.</div>

<p class='center'><b>Paper</b></p>

<p class="unindent">enough for the making of Christmas greens to decorate an ordinary
room quite lavishly may be bought for fifty cents or less.
One sheet of tissue paper will make thirty-two holly leaves. One
sheet of tissue paper will make a large bunch of mistletoe and
one sheet of tissue paper will make one yard of evergreen rope.
Complete success in this work depends largely upon the paper
used and great care must be taken in selecting the colors. The
quality should be good, else it will lack the necessary crispness
and staying properties.</p>

<p>For the holly and evergreen choose a dark moss-green paper,
which is a yellow green with no tinge of blue. For the mistletoe
you must have a light gray-green, also of a yellow tone, a light
cardinal red for the brilliant holly berries, white for the waxy
mistletoe berries and dark gray-brown for holly stems. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
sheet each of the red and white paper will probably be sufficient
for all the berries you will want, and one sheet of gray-brown will
answer for the stems. Besides the paper you must have a spool
of fine wire or coarse thread for winding and some natural bare
branches or twigs, or a roll of heavy bonnet wire for stems.</p>

Have a damp sponge ready

Take one leaf in your left
hand and with the moist
fingers of your right hand
twist each point of the leaf

two hands together and puffing the paper a little as you do so

crinkled appearance given by pinching and twisting adds much
to the natural look of the leaf. You may vary the size, making
some leaves smaller than others, but keep as nearly as possible
to the pattern, for experiment has proved it to be a good one.</p>

<p class="unindent">cut the gray-green tissue paper into pieces eight and one-half
inches long by one and a half inches wide. Bring the two ends of
a strip together, folding through the middle, to form the oblong
(<a href="#Fig_414">Fig. 414</a>). Fold <a href="#Fig_414">Fig. 414</a> lengthwise through the middle along
the dotted line and on it draw the outline of half of a mistletoe
leaf, with the straight edge on the long fold and the stem end on
the short fold of the paper (<a href="#Fig_415">Fig. 415</a>). Cut along this outline,
open the folds and you will have twin leaves like <a href="#Fig_416">Fig. 416</a>. Bring
the two open leaves together and twist the connecting part into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
a stem like <a href="#Fig_417">Fig. 417</a>. Make a number of white mistletoe berries
according to the directions given for the red holly berries and
wrap them together in pairs; then nestling a couple close in
between two leaves (<a href="#Fig_418">Fig. 418</a>) wrap them on the stem. The</p>

<p class='center'><b>Stems</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of the mistletoe should be very irregular and branching, and it
may be necessary to make them of bonnet wire in order to produce
the proper shape.</p>

<p>Fig. 419 shows the branching irregular stem and the position

they are so often on the natural mistletoe branch.</p>

<p>Fasten on the leaves and berries by wrapping with fine wire
and then cover the stems with strips of the gray-green tissue
paper, wrapping it as directed in making the holly branch. The
only difference being that while the holly stem is wrapped with
paper only far enough to cover the red stems of the berries and
the leaves are put on afterwards, the mistletoe leaves must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
fastened on with the berries and the entire stem then covered

mistletoe are as pale in color as the leaves, so no dark wood must
show in your branch.</p>

down flat and cut them open with a paper knife, then, keeping
the strips together, fold crosswise through the middle; again
fold crosswise through the middle and there will be an oblong
like <a href="#Fig_420">Fig. 420</a>. Cut this oblong into a fringe, bringing the slits
to within one inch of the top edge and making each strip not
more than one-quarter of an inch wide (<a href="#Fig_420">Fig. 420</a>). Unfold and
separate four pieces to loosen the fringe, then place the top edges
of the four pieces together once more and, taking a long piece of
strong twine, curl the right hand upper corner of the heading of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the fringe over the twine near the end (<a href="#Fig_421">Fig. 421</a>). From this
start to wrap the fringe around and around the twine forming
the rope shown in <a href="#Fig_422">Fig. 422</a>.</p>

<p>When you have almost reached the ends of the first four
strips of fringe, paste the ends of the headings of four more
strips on to the first and continue to wrap as before. In this way
you may make your evergreen rope as long as you wish.</p>

<p>There is just one word of caution which must go with the
assurance of the real beauty of these Christmas decorations and
that is: Remember to hang your wreaths and ropes where they
will not be exposed to the flames of gas, candle or lamp, for while
they are scarcely more inflammable than the natural greens, it is
not well to take any risks and neither is it at all necessary. With
this in mind your rooms may be inexpensively, prettily and safely
decorated with the tissue paper Christmas greens.</p>

<div class="drop-cap">COUNTRY houses are very attractive, even
the toy ones possess a certain charm.
Here is a great, big, beautiful, country
doll house for the doll people to live in.
It has window shutters to open and
close, doors that will open and shut, and
the doors have little door knobs like real
ones. Each room has a different, colored
frieze around the walls, and the floor of
the living-room is covered with a handsome rug. All the
windows are curtained, and the house is ready to furnish. You
can make any and all kinds of furniture with empty spools of
different sizes and pieces of pasteboard cut in various ways. As

<p>To make the doll house. Get three stiff pasteboard boxes

one-half inches high (<a href="#Fig_423">Fig.
423</a>). Cut the thirteen-inch
front and the right-hand side
from the first box (<a href="#Fig_424">Fig. 424</a>).
Take the second box and lay
the fourteen-inch front down
flat on top of an old, common
wooden table which can be
used without fear of injury,
and with the aid of a ruler,
draw two straight lines across the front on the inside of the box;
let each line be about one
and one-fourth inch from the
side. Keep the box as it is
while you score the lines with
a sharp penknife; then cut
out the front, leaving the
upright pieces to form the
corners at each end (<a href="#Fig_425">Fig. 425</a>).
Cut the thirteen-inch front
and left-hand side from the
third box (<a href="#Fig_426">Fig. 426</a>). Mark two high windows (<a href="#Fig_427">Fig. 427</a>) on
the inside, near the front of the
left side of the first box (<a href="#Fig_424">Fig.
424</a>). Make each window two
and one-half inches high and
two and one-half inches wide,
leaving a space of three-fourths
of an inch between
them. Lay this left side of
the box flat down on the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and use the sharp penknife to score the dotted lines and cut
the heavy lines. Always cut and score from the inside of the
box, otherwise the shutters
will turn inward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>THE MAKING OF A BAYBERRY CANDLE</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_352.jpg" width="130" height="165" alt="G" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">GROWING wild all along our eastern coast
from Nova Scotia to Florida is the
bayberry-bush, once well known and
valued, now overlooked and almost forgotten,
although a wealth of sweet smelling
wax is held in its tiny berries.</div>

<p>A quart of bayberries, a little time,
a little trouble, and we have a beautiful
green wax candle, hard, brittle and
smooth, that hot weather will not melt and whose expiring
flame yields an incense sweet and aromatic.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar joy in using the raw material fresh from
Mother Nature’s hands and starting at the beginning of things—a
joy unknown to those who work only with materials that
are manufactured—and to get the most out of the work of making
bayberry candles you must begin with the bayberries.
First locate your</p>

<p class='center'><b>Bayberry-Bushes;</b></p>

<p class="unindent">then, just the time when out-of-door exercise begins to be a delight,
the latter part of September or early in October, gather the
berries and take them home for future use.</p>

<p>The bayberries, which seem to be nothing but tiny stones
covered with a coating of wax, do not decay quickly, but shrivel
up into small gray pellets that will keep, it is said, a year or more.</p>

<p>Look for a bush that is stiff and irregular, generally growing
low in closely crowded patches like the blueberry, though at times
reaching the height of eight feet. It appears to thrive best and
is most often seen in sandy soil, but it will grow in almost any
kind and flourish even amid the rocks on a barren hillside.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 267px;"><a id="Fig_448"></a>
<img src="images/i_355.jpg" width="267" height="378" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 448.—The bayberry leaf looks like this.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>The Leaves</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are oblong and from two to three and a half inches in length
(<a href="#Fig_448">Fig. 448</a>). They usually have several teeth, or notches, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the tip and are quite narrow at the base. Sometimes they are
scattered and again in close bunches. The young leaves are a
pale green frequently tinged with red; when matured they are
a bright green, glossy, and of a leathery texture and they are very
fragrant when crushed in the hands. The bark is brownish
gray and the young stems light, or golden brown.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Berries</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are quite small and grow in thick clusters on short stems.
<a href="#Fig_449">Fig. 449</a> gives the berries, drawn from nature and of actual
size. They are green at first, but, when ripe, turn a light
silvery gray. As it will take about
one quart of berries to make one
candle you may adapt your picking
to the number of candles you want.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 158px;"><a id="Fig_449"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 449.—These are the bayberries,
actual size.</div>
</div>

<p>Keep the berries in a dry place
until</p>

<p class='center'><b>You are Ready to Make your Candles,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">then into a six-quart preserve-kettle
pour three quarts of berries and fill
to the brim with cold water. This
allows two quarts of water to one
quart of berries. Put the kettle on
the range and let it boil steadily four
hours—actually boil, remember—and
whenever the water gets three inches
below the brim fill it up with hot water.
The boiling berries will perfume the
house with a spicy balsamic odor that
is delightful. When the four hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
are up set the kettle back and let the berries simmer for an hour
or two, then farther back where it will simply keep hot. At night
take them off the range and set away to cool without removing
them from the kettle. The cooling down from the boiling point
to the point where the wax begins to form should be very gradual
to obtain the best results, therefore the simmering and keeping
hot after boiling.</p>

<p>Having put the berries away for the night, try to forget them,
and do not be tempted to disturb the wax as it forms and floats
in little cakes on top of the water, for breaking through the gathering
crust will cause much of the wax to sink and cling to the
berries beneath. When left undisturbed until morning, the wax
forms into a large cake, hard and ready to be lifted out.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Bayberry Wax</b></p>

<p class="unindent">is never, at first, free from impurities, such as bits of dried leaves,
stems and occasionally whole berries, and it must be strained.
Break up the wax and put it in a porcelain-lined, shallow saucepan
and set it on the range where it will melt slowly; then strain
through a fine wire strainer into a shallow bowl or soup-plate.
Let the wax become quite cold and hard, melt and strain again,
this time through a piece of cheese-cloth or fine sheer lawn.
So much for the bayberry wax. But there must also be</p>

<p class='center'><b>Candle-Moulds</b></p>

<p class="unindent">for making bayberry candles, and not many of us possess these
old-fashioned treasures. Even if you happen to be one of the
fortunate few, you will find it takes a great deal of the precious
wax to fill these old moulds, and the candles made in them are
really larger than you need; so the home-made candle-moulds
will be best in any case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;"><a id="Fig_452"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 452.—Pass a brush dipped in strong
glue over the end.</div>
</div>
<p>From a sheet of legal-cap writing-paper cut a strip eleven
and a half inches long and four inches wide (<a href="#Fig_450">Fig. 450</a>). Take an
ordinary adamantine half candle,
which is neither tallow
nor wax, and, placing the
paper on the table, short
edge toward you, lay the
candle down on it and bring
the edge of the paper over the candle, as in <a href="#Fig_451">Fig. 451</a>. Press
the paper down firmly and roll the candle away from you, in
this way wrapping the paper closely around it. If the edges
are not even, unwrap and try again. To have a perfect mould<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
you must keep one edge of the paper exactly on a line with the
bottom edge of the candle. When the paper is wrapped around
the candle to within one inch
of the end of the paper, brush
glue across the end of the paper
as in <a href="#Fig_452">Fig. 452</a>. Bring the edge
over the roll and press down
(<a href="#Fig_453">Fig. 453</a>).</p>


<p>Take another candle of the
same size, stand it on a piece of
paper and, with a lead-pencil,
draw around the bottom edge,
pressing the pencil point close to the candle. Cut around the
circle you have made, leaving a border on its edge half an inch
wide, as in <a href="#Fig_454">Fig. 454</a>, and slash the border up to the inner circle,
as in <a href="#Fig_455">Fig. 455</a>.</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Candlewicks.</b></p>

<p>Candlewick comes in balls. It is composed
of cotton strands which must be
braided to make a finished wick. Cut from
the wick several pieces nine inches long,
select three strands for each candle, tie them
together in bunches of threes, and braid,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_457">Fig. 457</a>.</p>

<p>Take the candle from the roll, and in the top edge of the roll
cut two notches directly opposite each other (<a href="#Fig_458">Fig. 458</a>), then
melt the candle and pour it while hot into the mould, emptying
it again directly. This will give the inside a coating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
wax which will keep the paper from absorbing the bayberry
wax.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 459.—Glue the wick to the bottom.</div>
</div>

<p>Puncture a small hole through the dot in the bottom of the
mould and, after waxing the end to stiffen it, thread one of the
wicks through the hole from the outside. Cut off the knot and
draw the wick up to within half an inch of the end, then separate
the strands, spread them out flat and glue them to the bottom
(<a href="#Fig_459">Fig. 459</a>). Glue the last disk you made, over the wick on the
bottom of the mould, arranging the
laps in order as you did those of
the first. Be very careful that
none of the slashes run even the
shortest distance across the bottom,
and do not use the moulds until the
glue is perfectly hard.</p>

<p>You will need a separate mould for each candle, and when all
are ready</p>

<p class='center'><b>Make a Stand of a Box.</b></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 460.—Cut three holes in the box.</div>
</div>

<p>In the bottom of the box, cut three round holes just large enough
to admit the candle-moulds (<a href="#Fig_460">Fig. 460</a>). Set the box in a small
meat-platter to catch any
spilled wax, and slip three
moulds into the holes, allowing
them to stand on the
plate. Draw the wick of
each up tightly and run a
long hat pin through all
three, resting the pin in the notches at the top and bringing each
wick in the middle of its mould (<a href="#Fig_461">Fig. 461</a>). If this is done properly
the wicks will not sag, but will be held taut by the pin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>Break up and</p>

<p class='center'><b>Melt the Bayberry Wax</b></p>

<p class="unindent">slowly, never allowing it to get hot
enough to smoke, and fill each mould
up to the hat pin. In a short time
the wax will settle and leave a hollow
at the top of the candle. Fill up the
hollow each time this occurs until
the wax remains even across the top.</p>

around spirally, as in <a href="#Fig_462">Fig. 462</a>.
Insert the blade of a penknife
between the bottom of the candle
and the bottom of the mould, and

one layer of the bottom, then the
other layer, after which you can

<p>Cut the bottom end of the wick
close to the candle, and also trim
off the top of the wick, making it
about one inch long above the
candle (<a href="#Fig_463">Fig. 463</a>).</p>

<div class="drop-cap2">THESE little wax people are very fond
of the water; in fact they are more at
home and far happier in the water
than when on land. Some of the wax
girls and boys will be content to sit on
the edge of the shore with their feet in
the water; others will cling with both
hands to the life-rope and dance up
and down as the little waves dash upon
them, though you will find that the
more daring ones are not satisfied with
jumping, but will often turn completely
over while still grasping the rope.</div>

ten pieces of folded white writing-paper after first tracing the
lengthwise half of <a href="#Fig_464">Fig. 464</a> on half of the paper (<a href="#Fig_465">Fig. 465</a>). Cut
ten boys (<a href="#Fig_466">Fig. 466</a>) from white writing-paper (<a href="#Fig_467">Fig. 467</a>). Paint
each girl’s hair a different color, varying from light brown to
raven black, from golden blond to dark auburn. Paint their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
bathing dresses red, blue, pink, orange,
brown, green, yellow, purple, striped
red and white, and spotted blue and
white. Paint the boys’ bathing suits in
a similar manner; mark the features of
both girls and boys in ink, then color face, hands, arms, legs
and feet pink. Use water-colors, and paint the back as well as
the front of the dolls. When the paint is dry, take two girls
and two boys and bend their arms forward at the shoulders;
bend several dolls in a sitting position; take others and bend
one leg forward and one backward, as if they were walking, and
bend the hands together in front on those you wish to dive into
the water from a height.</p>

half of the figure on it (<a href="#Fig_479">Fig. 479</a>) and cut out the mermaid (<a href="#Fig_480">Fig.
480</a>); then cut two pieces of rather long, finely fringed paper
(<a href="#Fig_481">Fig. 481</a>) for the hair, and paint them golden brown on both
sides. Paint the back of the mermaid’s head and the hair around
her face the same color. Mark the
features with ink; when dry, color the
face, arms and body pink; paint the
remaining part of the figure gray. After the paint has dried
mark fish scales from the waist down; then glue the straight top
fringe of hair across the centre of the back of the mermaid’s
head from side to side. Glue the other piece at the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
top of the back of the head. After the mermaid is thoroughly
dry, bend all of the hair out from her head. Do not allow any
of it to lie down flat. Bend the body a little backward in
a curve from the waist-line, the arms forward; then wax the
mermaid, hair and all (<a href="#Fig_482">Fig. 482</a>). When the mermaid is in
the water, the little wax children will make friends with her,
and she will perhaps tell them fairy stories of the beautiful life
under the waves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>HOW TO WEAVE WITHOUT A LOOM</small></h2>


<p class='center'><b>Method Invented by the Author</b></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_375.jpg" width="169" height="203" alt="R" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">RUGS, portières, table covers, bedspreads,
hammocks, in fact, almost anything that
can be woven of rags, can be woven without
a loom. Any one can do it, for the
process is extremely simple and all that is
required is a board, a paper of tacks and
some rags cut in strips. These may be
old rags or new, silk, cotton or wool,
and the piece may be woven heavy or
light, in a close weave or a loose one,
to suit its intended purpose. Many colors or few can be
used, and the patterns can be as varied as the colors, for any
design in straight lines can be followed in the weaving. A
snip of the scissors will cut off one color, a stitch or two insert
another, and so the pattern grows. It is quick work and you
will find it very absorbing as you sit amid your vari-colored rags
and see them grow beneath your fingers into harmoniously colored
hangings or soft, warm rugs.</div>

<p class='center'><b>A Board</b></p>

<p class="unindent">forty inches long will answer for weaving anything one yard or
less in width and is of a convenient size to handle. The one-yard
width is what an ordinary loom produces, but if you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
have your rug or portière wider there is no reason why the board
should not be longer. To prevent the material from catching,
your board must be smooth on both sides and on the edge and it
should be as wide as possible. A good-sized pastry board is
excellent for weaving a piece less than twenty-two inches in
width.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Rags are Used</b></p>

<p class="unindent">for both warp and woof; if old and soft they should be more
tightly packed than when new and firm. The warp is composed
of the strips which run up and down in the work, the woof
of those that are woven in and out across the warp, and the
process is like that of weaving a splint basket. The following
directions are for making</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Blue and White Cotton Rug</b></p>

<p class="unindent">for bedroom or bathroom. Heavy, new canton flannel is a good
material for the rug and it is better to have new goods where the
weave, as in this case, is to be smooth and flat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;"><a id="Fig_483"></a>
<img src="images/i_377a.jpg" width="211" height="373" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 483.—Tack one strip of blue on the line.</div>
</div>

<p>Cut the canton flannel, do not tear it, into strips half an inch
wide, but do not sew the strips together, and make into balls as
for loom weaving; piece them as needed while the work progresses.
Draw a straight line the whole length of the board one
inch below the top edge, then along this line</p>

<p class='center'><b>Tack the Warp</b></p>

<p>As there is to be a blue border four inches wide, entirely around
the rug, the warp at first must be all blue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 202px;"><a id="Fig_484"></a>
<img src="images/i_377b.jpg" width="202" height="274" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 484.—Fasten it down with another
tack.</div>
</div>

<p>Take one strip of the blue and tack it on the line at the upper
left-hand corner of the board about two inches from the side
edge. Leave one end of the warp longer than the other and
drive the tack only part of the way in (<a href="#Fig_483">Fig. 483</a>). Give the strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
two twists toward you, close to the tack, and fasten it down with
another tack on the line just half an inch from the first tack.
See <a href="#Fig_484">Fig. 484</a>.</p>

<p>Fasten your strips on in this way with the tacks half an inch
apart and you will have eight
ends or eight strips of warp
which will form the side border.
For the top border cut
the blue strips into ten-inch
pieces, twist them at the middle so that the ends will be of an
even length, and tack them along the line as far as you wish
the centre to extend; then add the longer strips of warp for the
other side border, as in <a href="#Fig_485">Fig. 485</a>. To the ends of the short blue
warp sew strips of white, lapping the ends with the blue on top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Sew them securely like <a href="#Fig_486">Fig. 486</a> and whip the end edges to make
them lie perfectly flat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 261px;"><a id="Fig_485"></a>
<img src="images/i_378a.jpg" width="261" height="148" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 485.—This will make a border.</div>
</div>

<p>This will give a white centre of warp with a blue border at
the top and sides. Draw each strip of warp down until it is
smooth and taut and tack it near the
bottom edge of the board. Be very
careful to have the warp of the border
and the centre measure the same distance across the bottom as
across the top and keep each strip in a straight line from the
top (<a href="#Fig_487">Fig. 487</a>). Frequent measurements while weaving will
keep your rug true and prevent narrowing between the two rows
of tacks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 108px;"><a id="Fig_486"></a>
<img src="images/i_378b.jpg" width="108" height="202" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 486.—Sew the pieces
securely.</div>
</div>

<p>When the warp is ready take a strip of blue and begin</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Weave.</b></p>

<p>Tack the end of the strip, which is now the warp, a little to
the left and a trifle below the upper left-hand tack (<a href="#Fig_487">Fig. 487</a>)
and, starting under the first strip of warp, weave it in and out
several times; then draw the warp out its full length as you
do a needle and thread after taking several stitches. Keep the
warp flat and even when it is woven and push it up close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
tacks. Weave across in this way, always under one and over
the next, and drawing out the end of the woof every little while.
When you have reached the last strip of warp on the right, turn
the woof over it and weave back again in the same manner (<a href="#Fig_487">Fig.
487</a>).</p>

<p>The woof for this rug is entirely of blue, and as you weave
across the white warp you will
find that it makes a blue and
white checker-board centre.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;"><a id="Fig_487"></a>
<img src="images/i_379.jpg" width="210" height="302" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 487.—Keep the warp perfectly straight.</div>
</div>

<p>When you have woven as
much as you can between the
two rows of tacks, take the
tacks out,</p>

<p class='center'><b>Move the Woven Part Up</b></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 259px;"><a id="Fig_488"></a>
<img src="images/i_380.jpg" width="259" height="344" alt="Diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 488.—After the rug has been moved up.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and tack across again along
the second or third row of
woof from the bottom, putting
a tack through the woof
into each strip of warp; then
draw the warp down as at
first and tack in place. <a href="#Fig_488">Fig.
488</a> shows the two rows of
tacks after the rug has been
moved up and also the effect
of the checker-board weaving and blue border. This manner of
moving up the woven part makes it possible to weave any length
you may desire.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Lengthen the Warp</b></p>

<p class="unindent">as you weave by sewing on new pieces, and when the centre is
almost as long as you want it, cut off the white warp evenly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
sew on blue, then weave until the border at the bottom is the
width of that at the top and sides. Cut off the woof that is left after
weaving the last row,
and, turning in the end,
sew it securely to the
last row of warp.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Cut Off the Warp,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">leaving ends about one
and one-half inches
long; turn each end of
the warp over the last
row of woof and sew
it down. One end will
turn on one side of the
rug, the next on the
other side, as splints
turn over the edge in
binding off a splint
basket.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 489.—Finish off the end of the rug in
this way.</div>
</div>

<p>It is best to cut off
one end of the warp
and sew it down before
cutting the next, as this will prevent the woof from slipping
out of place during the binding off. Tuck each end of the warp
under the row of woof just above it and sew again. <a href="#Fig_489">Fig. 489</a>
shows how this is done. G, H and I are the ends of the warp
cut off evenly, F is an end turned up and sewed to the bottom
row of woof. E is an end which is to turn under and be brought
up on the other side of the rug. D has been turned up, sewed
to the last row of woof and is just being slipped under the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a><br /><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a><br /><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
row of woof, J. C is turned under and fastened in place on the
other side of the rug, and B has been turned up, sewed,
tucked under the third row
of woof and sewed again. The
end is shown above the woof
to make the idea plainer, but
in reality it should be hidden
under the woof.</p>

<p>When the last end of the
warp has been secured and
the first end of the woof (Letter
A, <a href="#Fig_487">Fig. 487</a>) has been turned
over and sewed to the warp,
your rug is finished and will
look like <a href="#Fig_490">Fig. 490</a>. This rug
is photographed from one
made by the writer on a pastry
board. Its size is twenty-two
by thirty-four inches. Three-quarters
of a yard of white canton flannel and one yard and a
half of blue were used for weaving.</p>

<p class='center'><b>To Make a Heavier Rug</b></p>

<p class="unindent">with the flat weave, double the warp. That is, lay one piece
of warp directly on top of another, giving two thicknesses to each
strip. A close weave is made by using soft material, tacking the
strips close together for the warp and pushing the woof up
tightly, crushing it together as in loom weaving.</p>

<p>Diamonds, squares and Indian zigzag patterns are easy and
you can work out others quite original with yourself.</p>

<div class="drop-cap3">EVERYTHING awakens with new life and rejoices
on Easter; and the dear old Earth smiles
with sympathy and brings her offering of sweet
flowers. It is the day when all people, little
and big, young and old, should be filled with joy,
because Easter means the Resurrection. It
means life, light and immortality. It is the blest assurance and
certainty that love and goodness are the realities of life; far
more precious are they than the inanimate material things you
can see and touch. But we can use material things to convey
to our friends the invisible, wonderful good of love, joy, kindness,
sympathy, tenderness, and friendship.</div>

<p>A simple, inexpensive Easter card may carry with it happiness,
for “it is sweet to be remembered,” and you can think of
many designs from which to choose a cheery greeting to send to
every one.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 216px;"><a id="Fig_492"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 492.—The Easter flower card.</div>
</div>

<p class='center'><b>Cards Made to Represent Easter Flowers</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are always welcome. Trace <a href="#Fig_491">Fig. 491</a> on heavy paper; paint
the flowers to resemble as nearly as possible the natural blossoms,
shading the lily lightly and coloring the passion flower in natural
hues. Paint the violet a light blue purple and its foliage green.
When dry cut out the design; then bend the card at the dotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
lines that each flower may stand erect, supported
by the blank back piece in tent-like
fashion. When bent the card will form three
tents in a row, with the smallest in front, as
in <a href="#Fig_492">Fig. 492</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;"><a id="Fig_493"></a>
<img src="images/i_386a.jpg" width="116" height="207" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 493.—One half of the

<img src="images/i_386b.jpg" width="114" height="208" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 494.—The other half
of the cross.</div>
</div>

<p>If you are not able to paint the flowers
satisfactorily, use any colored, printed flowers
you happen to have, either the embossed ones
that come for scrap books, or those cut from
colored advertisements or newspapers. Select
three different blossoms or groups of flowers
and, taking the largest first, lay it down flat
on a strip of stiff paper with the stems or lower
part toward the edge of the paper; then run
a pencil line entirely around the edge of the
flower; this will give a blank enclosed by the
outline of the flower. Place the same blossom
on the paper again, being sure to bring the
top of the flower to meet the top of the outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
flower, in order that the two parts may fit; then make a
second tracing. Examine the lily in <a href="#Fig_491">Fig. 491</a> and you will understand
more clearly. Unless the two flower tops meet, one side
of the flower tent will be upside down.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 95px;"><a id="Fig_495"></a>
<img src="images/i_387a.jpg" width="95" height="201" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 495.—Put the two
halves together in
this way.</div>
</div>

<p>Place the middle-sized blossom on the paper with the lower
part next to the lower portion of the first and largest flower, in
the same way that the back support of the passion flower meets
the lily stems in <a href="#Fig_491">Fig. 491</a>. Trace this twice as you did the first
design. The last and smallest flower must be traced in like manner.
Notice in <a href="#Fig_491">Fig. 491</a> that the leaves of the violet meet the
lower part of the passion flower, while the blossom of the violet
meets the outline of the blossom.</p>

<p>When you comprehend the principle the work will be very
easy. Paste each bright blossom immediately in front of its
back support; then cut out the entire long card and bend it into
three tents which will enable the flowers to stand up and look
very attractive. These floral cards may be folded and brought
together in flat layers, to be sent by mail without danger of injury.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 497.—The open flower.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">is a most appropriate
design for Easter. You
can make one of cardboard
which will stand
alone. Cut <a href="#Fig_493">Figs. 493</a> and
<a href="#Fig_494">494</a> from stiff paper, and
make the slit down
through the top of one
and up through the bottom
of the other; then
slide the two crosses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
together by placing <a href="#Fig_493">Fig. 493</a> at right angles
down through the top of <a href="#Fig_494">Fig. 494</a>, adjust the
two pieces and your cross will resemble <a href="#Fig_495">Fig.
495</a>. The card may be closed flat by turning
the two crosses until they lie closely against
each other. You can decorate this double
cross by painting or pasting flowers on it, or
lettering it with the words, “Easter Greeting.”</p>

<p>Another new design is</p>

<p class='center'><b>The Tulip Bud</b></p>

<p class="unindent">(<a href="#Fig_496">Fig. 496</a>). This you can open at will and
make it
blossom.
Open it still further and the
petals appear as if ready to
fall, as in <a href="#Fig_497">Fig. 497</a>. Cut <a href="#Fig_498">Fig.
498</a> of white paper and paint
it to resemble a tulip petal;

<p>One of the most beautiful of manufactured Easter eggs was
the one presented to an Infanta of Spain some years ago. The
Gospel of Easter day was inscribed on the inside of the white
enamelled shell, and when a secret spring was touched a little
bird would fly out and sing. It was said to have cost four
thousand dollars. We can make an</p>

<p>Our Easter card of bells is fashioned after the old Spanish
style of architecture, in which the church
bells are often seen suspended in open
alcoves which are built up flat above the
body of the church. Copy <a href="#Fig_506">Fig. 506</a> on
cardboard and cut it out. Make three
bells like <a href="#Fig_507">Fig. 507</a> and fasten one on each
of the three round dots on the church
belfry (<a href="#Fig_506">Fig. 506</a>). Sew the bells in place
as you did the tulip petals, but in this
case allow the thread to be a trifle looser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
that the bells may sway back and forth, as if ringing, when you
move the card. Cut up the slit through the centre of the stand of
the card and crease along the dotted line, bending half of the
stand forward and the other half backward. This will give a
good platform and the card will
stand alone (<a href="#Fig_508">Fig. 508</a>). Make the
belfry (<a href="#Fig_506">Fig. 506</a>) of a warm gray-colored
cardboard and gild the cross
and bells. When dry indicate a
slight shading with pen and ink.</p>

<p>Fig. 538 shows the head of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Napoleon,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and that you may not be behind the times
in your hero worship, I am going to tell
how you may make a little Napoleon for yourself. At least you
may make a Napoleon head, and Napoleon’s head was really
the greatest part of him; his heart, I fear, was not so great, and
his body, we know, was insignificant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Use a goose egg for the head; the dimensions given for the
hat are intended for a large egg. Blow the egg from the shell
in the manner described. Make the largest hole in the small end
of the shell and enlarge this hole to the size of a silver dime.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 297px;"><a id="Fig_538"></a>
<img src="images/i_402.jpg" width="297" height="249" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 538.—Napoleon.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, Napoleon had what is called a well-balanced head.
That was one cause of his greatness; it could not be upset by
anything that went on around him. So, to make a head that will
bear the stamp of Napoleon’s character, we must contrive to
have it keep its position, or balance; to stand erect, unaided and
alone, and it can be done in this way:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 193px;"><a id="Fig_539"></a>
<img src="images/i_403a.jpg" width="193" height="195" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 539.—Napoleon’s face.</div>
</div>

<p>When the egg has been blown from the shell place the shell in
a perfectly upright position, large end down, in an egg-cup, or
anything that will hold it steady. Into the large hole pour a
little melted sealing wax, and on top of that pour a little melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
lead, or some pieces of shot,
taking care to have the weight
fall directly in the centre to make
a perfect balance.</p>

<p>Fig. 539 is Napoleon’s face,
which you must draw on one
side of the egg with black ink.
Ink the hair black. Blacken
the shell on the other side, too,
for the hair on the back of the
head. In drawing the face on
the shell remember that the
largest end of the shell is the chin, the smallest end the top
of the head. To be sure, the real Napoleon never had a hole
in the top of his head that we ever heard of, but the hole in the
top of our Napoleon’s
head will not show
when his hat is on,
and as the hat is to be
glued in place no one
will ever be any the
wiser.</p>

</div>

<p>To make the hat, or</p>

<p class='center'>“<b>Chapeau Bras</b>,”</p>

<p class="unindent">as Napoleon would
have called it, and
which means a military
cocked hat, you
must have some black
paper. For the brim a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
piece five inches square will be needed, as it measures just that
many inches from front to back and from side to side. Cut out
the brim from pattern (<a href="#Fig_540">Fig. 540</a>). Cut the hole near the centre
and cut the slits around it as shown by the heavy lines. Bend
up the little strips or laps, as denoted by the dotted line around
the hole. The other dotted lines show where the brim is to be
turned up front and back, but the crown must be glued on first.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 158px;"><a id="Fig_541"></a>
<img src="images/i_404.jpg" width="158" height="156" alt="Crown of Napoleon's chapeau bras" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 541.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 541 is the pattern of the
crown. From front to back it measures
three inches; from side to side,
at its widest part, three and a quarter
inches; at the narrowest part the
measure is two inches. The heavy
line shows where it is to be cut, the
dotted line where it is to be folded.
Turn in the laps at the sides, bring
them together and paste neatly. Fit
the crown on the brim, over the laps
of the brim, and paste the laps of the brim to the inside of the
crown. Turn up the brim according to the dotted lines on <a href="#Fig_540">Fig.
540</a>. At the points shown by the crosses on the front of the
brim put a drop of paste and bring them up to meet the crosses
on the crown of the chapeau. Place Napoleon’s chapeau on
Napoleon’s head as in <a href="#Fig_538">Fig. 538</a>, and glue it to the shell. Now set
the little hero before you on the table, touch him with your
finger, and, if the weight has been well placed, he will nod and
bow, but his head will always regain its level position.</p>

<p>Hero though he is, Napoleon is the better for a companion,
and we will give him his first wife, Josephine, whom he crowned
Empress of France on December 2, 1805, the day of his own
coronation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>To express in a measure the regal dignity of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Josephine</b></p>

<p class="unindent">on that occasion, her head must also be held erect; prepare the
shell, therefore, as you did the one for Napoleon’s head, with this
difference—place the weight in the small end of the egg-shell,
instead of the large end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;"><a id="Fig_544"></a>

</div>

<p>Draw Josephine’s queenly countenance (<a href="#Fig_542">Fig. 542</a>) on the
egg-shell, placing her chin at the small end. Make her tiara of
gold paper, which you can spangle, if you like, to represent
the diamonds of which it was composed. <a href="#Fig_543">Fig. 543</a> shows how
to cut it. <a href="#Fig_544">Fig. 544</a> is the pattern for her crown and should also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
be made of gold paper. Paste the two ends of the band of the
crown together to form a circle, then draw the ends of the arches
together to meet in the middle, over the top. Fasten these together
with needle and thread on which a small glass bead has
been strung. The bead will hide the stitches and also take the
place of the small cross which occupies that position on the crown
of the real Empress. With your finger curve the arches out as
shown in the sketch of the finished head (<a href="#Fig_545">Fig. 545</a>).</p>

<p>The crown and tiara are not fastened together, but are placed
on separately, for Josephine wore the diamond tiara when she
was crowned. Glue the tiara to the head first, bringing the ends
around to meet rather low down at the back; then set the crown
back of the tiara and glue in place.</p>

<p>From a piece of white tissue paper cut a ruff, after pattern
(<a href="#Fig_546">Fig. 546</a>); crimp the ruff with the blade of a knife or scissors
and glue to the back and sides of Josephine’s head.</p>

<p>Holes must now be made in the shell for the legs to come
through, as shown in <a href="#Fig_547">Fig. 547</a>. This is done by boring carefully
with a large, sharp-pointed needle (being cautious not to
crack the shell in the process), until the holes are large enough
to admit the wire. Use a piece of ordinary black hat-wire, four
inches long, for the legs, bend in the shape of <a href="#Fig_553">Fig. 553</a> and slip
through the holes in the shell. Cut a piece of wire two inches
long, and another one inch in length, for the foot; bend in the

Cover the edges neatly

Paste a piece of the same

made in the same way
as described for “Good

the body. In the illustration (<a href="#Fig_558">Fig. 558</a>) the egg is shown both

<small>HOME-MADE CANDLESTICKS</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_411.jpg" width="164" height="230" alt="I" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">IF you are working in clay try making
a few candlesticks. If you haven’t
the clay, why not get some at once
and begin this most fascinating work?</div>

<div class="caption">Fig. 559.—Cut the clay in two with a knife.</div>
</div>

<p>Candlesticks are always decorative;
even the old tin candlestick with its
half burnt tallow candle has a certain
picturesqueness that the artist recognizes
when he chooses that as an
accessory to his picture instead of the
prosaic oil lamp. Then again, candlesticks give a wide scope to
individuality in design, and that it gives expression to one’s
originality is one of the greatest charms of pottery making.</p>

<p>A potter’s wheel is not at all necessary. The primitive
method of coiling the clay and gradually, without hurry, building
it up into the form desired is far the better way for home workers.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Get Your Clay</b></p>

<p class="unindent">at the nearest pottery where anything finer than flower pots is
made, and if it is a place where they turn out only earthenware
ask for their finest clay. Very frequently they make a quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of extra pieces for holiday trade and for these prepare a finer
clay than they ordinarily use. Fifty pounds of clay will keep
you busy a long while and twenty-five pounds will be sufficient
for a number of small pieces. It sells at about one and a half
cents per pound at most of the potteries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 586px;">
<img src="images/i_413.jpg" width="586" height="392" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption">This Pottery was Made by the Author.</div>
</div>

<p>Break your dry clay into small pieces with a hammer and
then pound to a powder. Put it into an earthen crock that has
a cover of its own, and mix with water until it is of the consistency
of dough. If you are not to use it immediately, and it is
rather stiff, make several holes in the clay with your finger, fill
each hole with water, cover the crock closely with its lid and set
away until wanted.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 561.—Useful in cutting the clay.</div>
</div>

<p>When you are</p>

<p class='center'><b>Ready for Work</b></p>

<p class="unindent">take out a good sized lump of clay, put it on a pastry board and
knead it like bread. This is to work out all the air and make
the grain close and
fine. If the clay seems
too stiff spread it out
in a flat cake, pour a
little water in the middle,
bring the edges
together and knead
again until the whole
piece is softened.
When the clay is too
soft spread it out and
put it in the air where it will soon stiffen. If it is freezing out
of doors do not expose the clay but let it dry off in the house.
From time to time, while you are working the clay, cut the lump
in two with a palette knife or ordinary table knife (A, B, <a href="#Fig_559">Fig. 559</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Put the outside edges
together (C, D, <a href="#Fig_560">Fig.
560</a>) and continue
kneading. The professional
potter has
a wire strung above
his table and on it
cuts his clay quickly
and neatly in half,
but a knife will answer very well. You may have a number of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Modelling Tools</b></p>

<p class="unindent">or a few, and you can do very well with two or three contrived
by yourself. A wire tool like <a href="#Fig_561">Fig. 561</a> is useful in cutting away
the clay when the walls of a piece are too thick, but a wire hairpin
answers the purpose almost
as well. A wooden
skewer, used by butchers for
pinning meat, is also good
for some purposes. In my
own work one summer, when far out of reach of modelling
tools, I found use for a palette knife, the handle of an old spoon,
a hairpin and a steel ink eraser with a curved blade. But best
of all and most to be depended upon are the fingers, for these
sensitive, flexible, natural tools can perform most of the work
alone. <a href="#Fig_562">Fig. 562</a> is a small jar made entirely with the hands, no
tool of any kind, save the fingers, having been used in the
modelling. You should have a good</p>

<p class='center'><b>Strong Table,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">one you have no fear of harming, and that stands firmly and
evenly on the floor; a piece of smooth, rather thick board about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
ten inches square upon which to build your pottery and a small
pastry board. Place the table near a window where there is
plenty of light and under it lay a piece of oilcloth to protect the
floor; thus prepared you may plunge into your work and accomplish
wonders without disturbing the general order of the
room. At a convenient place on the table set a small bowl of
water and a cup of slip. The slip is simply clay softened in
water until it is about as thick as cream. A large piece of old
muslin, that you can tear in pieces as needed, should always be
at hand, and a wet sponge on which to wipe your fingers.</p>

<p>Place your pastry board on the table and when the clay is
kneaded lay it to one side and scrape the board, clearing off all
dried particles. Unless this precaution is taken crumbs of dry
clay are apt to mix with the moist clay and make it rough and
gritty.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_563">Figs. 563</a>, <a href="#Fig_564">564</a> and <a href="#Fig_565">565</a> are three original designs in candlesticks.
We will take one of these for a model. <a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a> is the
simplest and most easily made, so we will begin with that.</p>

<p>Have ready a rather deep</p>

<p class='center'><b>China Saucer,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">tear off a square of muslin large enough to cover the inside of
the saucer and to extend over its edge. Dip the muslin in the
bowl of water and lay it flat in the saucer, pressing it down as
evenly as possible and smoothing out the air bubbles.</p>

<p>Now take</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Large Handful of Clay,</b></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 260px;"><a id="Fig_566"></a>
<img src="images/i_419a.jpg" width="260" height="230" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 566.—Roll the clay back and forth.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">roll it between your palms, lay it on the pastry board in front of
you and with an even pressure of your hands roll it back and
forth until it lengthens out and forms a snake-like piece a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
more than half an inch in
diameter (<a href="#Fig_566">Fig. 566</a>). Do
not let the roll flatten,
keep it as round as possible
and of an equal size
from end to end, then
press it with your fingers
and flatten the top just
enough to take off its
roundness. When this is
done place one end of the
roll narrow side up exactly
in the centre of the
saucer and make</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Close Coil</b></p>

<p class="unindent">like <a href="#Fig_567">Fig. 567</a>, bringing
the edges of the coils
together with your
thumb nail. When
you have coiled one
roll make another roll
and, cutting the end
of each, like <a href="#Fig_568">Fig. 568</a>,
fit them together and
make a smooth and
even joint.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 295px;"><a id="Fig_567"></a>
<img src="images/i_419b.jpg" width="295" height="262" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 567.—Make a close coil.</div>
</div>

<p>Continue to coil
the clay until the
saucer is filled to the
edge, then build it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
one coil higher on the edge
and cut the last end of the
roll as you did the first. Press
this end down to join the roll
beneath it, making the joint
invisible. Now</p>

<p class='center'><b>Dip Your Fingers in Water</b></p>

<p class="unindent">and rub them gently over the coiled clay in the saucer to smooth
it, but be careful not to get it too wet and not to lower the coil
on the edge in the process. If depressions occur fill them with
fresh clay joining the edges of the new clay to the coiled clay,
making it one piece with no cracks or seams. In adding clay at
any time the new piece must always become one with the old,
else it will crack when dry or in the firing, and it is best to brush
the place to be filled with slip before adding the clay. Set your
saucer away at this stage of the work until the clay stiffens a
little and the piece becomes what is called “set.” It is just here
that you must use patience, for to continue to work while the
clay is too soft will frequently spoil the whole thing and the only
remedy is to bunch the clay and begin over again. To be successful
in the making of pottery one’s enthusiasm must be of the kind
that will not cool during the necessary waiting periods.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 568.—Cut the ends like this.</div>
</div>

<p>When the clay in your saucer has become firm but is still
quite pliable, dip another square of muslin in water, spread it
inside the clay saucer and</p>

<p class='center'><b>Fit in Another Saucer</b></p>

<p class="unindent">of china a trifle smaller than the first. This will give you a pile
of three saucers one within the other, first china, then clay, then
china. Now cover your small board with wet muslin and turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
your stack of saucers upside down on the board. Lift off the top
saucer and you have your clay saucer inverted on top of the
smaller china saucer. You will find all the seams of the coil
showing on this underside and must join them and make the
clay one piece as you did on the inside. With your wire tool
(<a href="#Fig_561">Fig. 561</a>) or a hairpin, carefully</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 182px;"><a id="Fig_569"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 569.—Wrap the candle with a strip

</div>
<p class='center'><b>Cut Down the Parts</b></p>

<p class="unindent">that seem too thick, but at the same time beware of making them
so thin as to weaken the walls of the saucer. It is better to fill
out and make a piece rather heavy than to try at first to obtain
the delicacy one naturally desires, for thin walls often collapse
in unaccustomed hands. As you work, turn the board around
and around to be sure the contour is symmetrical. It is often a
good thing to raise the work to the level of the eye in order
the better to detect inaccuracies of outline.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 570.—Stand the candle in the centre of the
saucer.</div>
</div>
<p>When you have finished the underside and the clay seems
firm enough to stand without support, turn it right side up on
the board, always with the wet muslin between to keep it from
sticking. Lift out the small saucer which is still in the clay
saucer and proceed to remove all traces of the line in the clay
made by the ridge on the bottom of the china saucer. This can
be done by smoothing down and adding more clay to make a
curve instead of an angle.</p>


<p>With the wooden skewer make a dot in the centre of the clay
saucer, measuring the distance to be sure it is exact, then take</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Half Candle,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">wrap it spirally and closely with a narrow strip of wet muslin
(<a href="#Fig_569">Fig. 569</a>) and stand it directly over the mark (<a href="#Fig_570">Fig. 570</a>). Make
little crossed lines with a sharp tool, or hat pin, around the candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
like <a href="#Fig_571">Fig. 571</a>; then roll some clay for coiling the candle holder,
flattening the roll as you did for the saucer.</p>

a little over two inches from
the saucer, then sharpen the
end of your roll and join
it to the top (E, <a href="#Fig_573">Fig. 573</a>).
With a brush dipped in slip,
fill up, to some extent the
creases between the coils and
make the coil even and round

the base of the holder to the saucer, then the larger coil which
connects the small coil, and
the inside and the outside of
the saucer. Use your first
finger for keeping the hole in
the centre of the large coil the
proper size. Build up the
edge of the saucer slantingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
to join the inner coil of the handle (F, <a href="#Fig_574">Fig. 574</a>) and allow a
ridge to extend from the outer coil a short distance along the
outside of the saucer (G, <a href="#Fig_574">Fig. 574</a>).</p>

<p class='center'><b>This Blending of Decoration with the Article</b></p>

<p class="unindent">itself, making it appear a natural outgrowth from it, is a law of
beauty in modeled decoration, which should always be kept in
mind. No part of a piece of pottery should look as if it were
simply stuck on and might drop off again, but rather as though
it were a necessary part of the whole.</p>

<p>When your candlestick is in good shape and still moist, go
over it with a camel’s-hair brush dipped in water, smoothing
down any little unevenness in this way. Sometimes a coating
of slip, well worked in with the brush will give a good surface.
Set the piece away after this and let it stand undisturbed for
several days, or until the clay has become quite dry and has turned
almost white, then if it is still imperfect in shape</p>

<p class='center'><b>Scrape it Down</b></p>

<p class="unindent">with a steel tool or pocket knife. The clay is so easily shaved
off at this stage the danger lies in making too deep a cut and the
work should be done gradually and patiently. For the final
rubbing use a piece of fine emery paper. Even this must be
carefully handled, for if pressed heavily on the clay it, also, will
cut too deeply.</p>

<p>Do not put your work away to dry in the sun or near a fire.
If dried too rapidly the clay will crack. Sometimes it will crack
when it dries, never so gradually; it may be from shrinkage or
because the clay has not been sufficiently kneaded.</p>

<p class='center'><b>If Cracks Occur</b></p>

<p class="unindent">while the clay is still moist fill in with new clay and slip. If the
piece is perfectly dry mix some finely powdered baked clay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
water, making a thick paste, and fill the opening. You may be
able to get the unglazed baked clay at the pottery, but if not put
a thin cake of clay in any kind of a very hot oven and allow it
to bake several hours, then grind to a fine powder. Keep this
powder in a labelled box that it may always be at hand when
needed.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that when a piece of pottery cracks
in the firing there is no remedy. This is very likely true with
pieces that have been glazed, but with unglazed ware my own
experience has proved that it can be mended. When an unglazed
piece comes from the firing showing cracks, large or
small, mix a thin slip of clay with a little finely powdered flint
and run into the cracks until they are more than filled, then
rub or scrape off the surplus. This formula was given me by
a prominent art potter who also furnished the mixture.</p>

<p>In putting away</p>

<p class='center'><b>Unfinished Work,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">cover with a damp cloth and keep the cloth damp until you are
ready to go on with your modeling. Once hard the clay can no
longer be worked, and unfinished pottery must always be kept
moist. In the case of a piece having handles, spouts and like
projections, place something under the cloth to hold it away from
these parts and prevent its pushing them out of shape.</p>

<p class='center'><b>You May Glaze Your Candlestick</b></p>

<p class="unindent">with colored glaze before it is fired or you may have it fired and
returned to you in “the bisque,” when it can be glazed and sent
to be fired the second time. One firing really seems all that is
necessary for small pieces, however. <a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a> was fired but
once, the glaze having been applied to the unbaked clay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
it came from the pottery in a perfectly satisfactory condition,
without crack or blemish.</p>

<p>The glaze used for all the pottery in the little group in our
full-page illustration, is Marshing’s soft Limoges glaze which
may be obtained where mineral colors for pottery and china
painting are sold. The glaze is transparent when fired and is to
be mixed with color unless the piece has underglaze decoration
or the clay is colored. The proportion is one part dry color to
nine parts dry glaze. Both come in powders and must be
thoroughly mixed, then dissolved in a solution of gum arabic.
Eight and one-half teaspoonfuls of glaze to one-half teaspoonful
of underglaze color is sufficient for two candlesticks. Apply this
with a No. 8 camel’s-hair brush and give the piece three coats,
waiting each time for one coat to become thoroughly dry before
putting on the next. Lay the color on evenly and do not allow
little streams of glaze to run over the edges.</p>

<p>There are various</p>

<p class='center'><b>Other Methods of Coloring Pottery.</b></p>

<p class="unindent">One is to work the dry color into the moist clay by kneading.
For the little pitcher (<a href="#Fig_575">Fig. 575</a>) one tablespoonful of raw sienna
was thoroughly worked into a lump of clay the size of a large
apple and the pitcher then modelled from the colored clay. Prepared
mineral color was not used, but dry “raw or green” color
purchased at an ordinary paint shop. When quite dry the
pitcher turned a beautiful ivory yellow, but became almost
terra cotta when fired. The uncolored glaze was dissolved in
gum arabic and applied after the first firing, and the pitcher
was fired a second time.</p>

<p>Another way to color your pottery is to mix the raw color with
slip the consistency of cream and with it paint a design on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
unbaked clay. A little gum arabic added to the slip will make
it adhere more closely and prevent its rubbing off. This must
be fired before the uncolored glaze is applied. The little bowl
(<a href="#Fig_576">Fig. 576</a>) was decorated in this way and the colors used were
raw sienna and burnt sienna. But one coat of glaze was given
the bowl which makes it look more like old Indian ware than
if it had the very glossy surface.</p>

<p>Colored pottery</p>

<p class='center'><b>“In the Bisque”</b></p>

<p class="unindent">or unglazed state is often very beautiful and if designed to hold
water or liquid of any kind the inside alone may be glazed,
leaving the outside in its natural dull and porous condition.</p>

<p>Of the various designs shown here the saucers were used
only for <a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a>, and the sooner you are able to discard all such
aids and depend upon your eye alone to guide your hands the
more you will enjoy your work.</p>

<p>Probably you can have your candlesticks fired at the pottery
where you get your clay, but if you wish to carry on the work
and experiment for yourself secure a kiln of your own by all
means.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>WHAT TO MAKE OF BANANAS, ORANGES, AND APPLES</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_429.jpg" width="153" height="178" alt="W" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap">WHILE icy blasts are still sweeping
through the cities of the North, while
the snow lies deep on the ground, and
the children, bundled up until little
except their pink noses is visible,
are coasting, sleighing, and snowballing,
in the South soft breezes are sifting
through the green leaves of the trees
and gently stirring the beautiful flowers
blossoming in the warm sunshine.</div>

<p>In the orange groves the great golden balls are ripening, and
on the long-leaved banana trees hang the queer bunches of
bananas, growing in their funny upside-down fashion. Pineapples,
lemons and many other fruits are there, all growing and
ripening that the children of the North may have them when
their own delicious strawberries, peaches and plums have gone.</p>

<p>We are very glad of these Southern fruits, even the skins
seem too good to throw away. And so they are.</p>

<p class='center'><b>Save Your Orange, and Banana, and Apple Skins,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">too, and see what delightful things you can make of them.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, before there were any steamboats, sailboats
or even rowboats in the British Isles, when men’s clothes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
merely the skins of wild beasts tied on with leather thongs, the
people went on the water in little circular boats called coracles.
These boats were wickerwork baskets covered with the hides
of animals and resembled bowls in shape. They were sent skimming
over the water very rapidly by means of a paddle which was
dipped in first on one side of the boat then on the other. The
coracles were so small a man easily carried his boat on his back
to transport it over dry land, looking, one would think, very much
like a huge turtle walking on its hind legs.</p>

<p>It is a boat like this most primitive one that you can make of</p>

<p class='center'><b>Half of an Orange Skin</b></p>

<p>It will float, too, and ride safely the roughest waves of the bathtub
sea. As it is perfectly water-tight, Miss Dolly need have no fear
of wetting her dainty skirts as she sits in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Cut an orange exactly in halves like <a href="#Fig_577">Fig. 577</a>. Slide the
blade of a penknife around the edge, loosening the pulp from the
skin, then cut the pulp in quarters
and remove it piece by piece as in
<a href="#Fig_578">Fig. 578</a>. When all is taken out you
have your little boat (<a href="#Fig_579">Fig. 579</a>) and
your orange besides.</p>

Indians at the time when Columbus discovered America. You
know, of course, that a banana has several ridges on its surface
with wide, smooth spaces between and that the stem end curves
up more decidedly than the other. Along the middle of the
smooth space which takes the upward curve of the stem you must
make a slit with the sharp point of your knife, as shown by the
black line on the banana in <a href="#Fig_580">Fig. 580</a>. Open the slit carefully,
cut the banana in small pieces and
take out one piece at a time (<a href="#Fig_581">Fig. 581</a>).</p>

<p>The apple lantern, or</p>

<p class='center'><b>Fairy Lamp</b></p>

<p class="unindent">(<a href="#Fig_585">Fig. 585</a>) requires a little more time and patience in its preparation
than the boats, but it is not difficult to make. Find a rather
small, perfectly round, red apple without
bruise or blemish. Hold it in
both hands and gently press it with
your two thumbs, beginning close to
the stem and gradually working down
to the blossom end. Be careful not
to break the skin, but press and press
until every part is loosened and the
apple feels pulpy like a grape—every
part except the blossom; that holds
fast because it is attached to the core.
When no hard spots can be found cut a circle around the stem
as shown in <a href="#Fig_586">Fig. 586</a>, and little by little dig out the apple until
nothing but the skin remains (<a href="#Fig_587">Fig. 587</a>); then you will find a
small lump at the bottom which must be left, since cutting it
out would result in a hole in the skin. With a pair of sharp
scissors trim away all unevenness or raggedness that may be found
on the edge. This will make the opening a trifle larger.</p>

<div class="drop-cap">PLACE a chair against one end of the bath
tub, for Spain, and another chair at the
other end of the tub for America. If
the chair seat is lower than the rim of
the tub, build up with books until the
top book is as high as the tub; then fill
the bathtub more than half full of water
and pretend it is the Atlantic ocean. Cut
out two paper dolls, one for King Ferdinand,
the other for Queen Isabella.
Remember which chair is Spain, and seat the royal couple in
Spain, on a throne, made of a bent piece of cardboard. Bring
Columbus before the monarchs and let them bid him Godspeed;
then put Columbus in his ship, the <i>Santa Maria</i>, with a
number of sailors, and send the vessel sailing off on her voyage of
discovery. Gently push the boat forward by the projecting spar
at the stern, and the little craft will sail along like a real ship on
a real ocean; but you must be careful not to push too hard and
capsize the vessel. When the boat reaches America, have ready
on the chair at that end of the bathtub, some wild Indians with
their wigwams, and let Columbus and his men land, while the
Indians stand gazing at them in astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></div>

<p>Before we make
the little paper people,
let us build</p>

<p class='center'><b>Columbus’ Ship.</b></p>

<p>This ship is to be
as nearly like the
<i>Santa Maria</i>, the
real ship in which
Columbus sailed, as
is possible to make
of paper. Cut a
piece of light-weight
cardboard fifteen
and three-fourths
inches long and
seven and one-half
inches wide; on this
draw the diagram of
the boat (<a href="#Fig_589">Fig. 589</a>),
making the greatest
lengths of the diagram
exactly as long
and the greatest
widths as wide as
the cardboard. Find
the lengthwise centre
of the cardboard,
which will be three
and three-fourths
inches from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
long side line, as the cardboard is seven and one-half inches
wide. Draw a line along the centre from end to end, to guide
you in making the diagram of the boat; this central line will
also be the centre of your ship. Commence drawing the bottom
A—A (<a href="#Fig_589">Fig. 589</a>) at a distance of two and one-fourth inches
from the end of the cardboard; the bottom must measure seven
inches from its extreme front point A to the back line A, and
two and three-eighths inches at its widest point from B to B.
The point A of the bottom must come on the long central line,
and the straight back line of the bottom A must be one and
three-fourths inches across.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 591.—Cut the
bowsprit like this.</div>
</div>
<p>The length of the extension at the back of the boat from C
to D is three and one-half inches; the deck from D to E, three
inches. The greatest width of the deck, E, not including the
two flaps, is two and three-fourth inches, and the narrowest part
at the line D one inch. The sides of the boat are slashed and
the last slash or side piece, F, at its greatest height touches the
edge of the cardboard, while the side pieces G and G, are the
lowest, and so are the longest distance from the cardboard edge.
When you have drawn the diagram cut out the little craft.</p>

<p>Cut along all the heavy lines. Bend the four dotted lines
of the prow ledge (H, I and H, I) backward. All other dotted
lines must be bent forward, and care taken to keep the bends
exactly on the dotted lines. Do not bend the laps enclosed by
the tiny circles along the sides J, J, J, J, J, J. These circles
merely show how far the slashed sides lap over each other to
form the correct shape of the <i>Santa Maria</i>, for you must know
that Columbus’ vessel was very different in build and appearance
from any ships we find at the present time. The prow
and stern were much higher than the middle of the boat and at
the top the stern was quite narrow while at the bottom it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
wide, making the rear of the ship big at the bottom
and small at the top.</p>


<p>Now put the little craft together. Bend the sides
up and fasten each lap on the edge of the next
side piece with glue or strong, thick paste. Bend
up the back and paste the three laps of each edge
over onto the sides, fitting the short laps on the
section K over the projections L and L of the sides.</p>

tight on the bottom of the boat, a trifle forward

the holes slightly by inserting
the point of a lead pencil and
twisting the pencil gently around
(<a href="#Fig_599">Fig. 599</a>). Remember that all
holes for the masts to run through
must be made rather small, to prevent
the sails from sliding too far
down the masts. Bend the top

curve the paper, that the sails may
appear to be in a good stiff breeze
when fastened on the masts. Slide the foresail you have just

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<small>HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH
THE STARS</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_450.jpg" width="207" height="207" alt="I" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap3">WHEN you used to recite about
the cow jumping over the
moon, you did not know that
there were all sorts of animals
and people up among the stars
near the moon, and, while they
may never have followed the
example of the cow in the
nursery rhyme, probably they
often feel as though they would enjoy doing so. But these
starry people and their pets are very well behaved, and so far
they have been perfectly content to remain exactly where they
were placed hundreds of years ago.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;"><a id="Fig_616"></a>
<img src="images/i_451a.jpg" width="262" height="206" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 616.—Ursa Major, the Great Bear.</div>
</div>

<p>There is one animal in particular with which you must make
friends—a bear, an immense creature called</p>

<p class='center'><b>Ursa Major.</b></p>

<p>Never could an earthly bear have such a tail as you see in <a href="#Fig_616">Fig.
616</a>. However, the Great Bear is very different from the ordinary
bear, and needs the big, bushy tail for three bright stars.
Four more equally bright stars are on the creature’s side. Trace
the big bear on cardboard, and be sure to get the stars in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
right places. Cut out
the pasteboard bear,
and with a large, coarse
pin or needle pierce a hole
in the centre of each star;
then hold the bear up to the
light, as the little girl holds
the lion in <a href="#Fig_617">Fig. 617</a>. Look
through the bear and you
will see seven tiny, twinkling
stars forming a dipper. Pretend
you have stretched a
string from star to star, and what you
will see will resemble <a href="#Fig_618">Fig. 618</a>. Look
again and if the dipper is not distinct,
make the holes in the centres of the stars
larger.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;"><a id="Fig_617"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig. 617.—Making friends with
the stars.</div>
</div>

<p>After you have learned precisely
how Ursa Major looks with its starry
dipper, and can see it even with your
eyes closed, peep out into the night and
try to find your friend up in the real
sky. The bear is there, but you must
recognize it by the dipper, for of course
you cannot really see the animal itself.
When you find the dipper you will
know that the Great Bear is in the
sky looking down upon you. You can
see the big bear during the early
evening hours of March, April, May,
June and July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 619 gives another bear,
a little one, whose name is</p>

<p class='center'><b>Ursa Minor;</b></p>

<p class="unindent">he also has a long tail spangled
with stars and four more stars
on the side of his body which
form a little dipper; the three
stars on the tail make the
handle. Though the bear is
small, he is very important because
of the large star on the
end of his tail, which you
must call the Pole star. This
star shines out to show which
direction is north when one
gets lost or confused about
his way. The Pole star
may always be depended
upon as a guide, and sailors look for it
to help them find their course through the
waters.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 208px;"><a id="Fig_619"></a>
<img src="images/i_452c.jpg" width="208" height="200" alt="drawing constellation, crazy looking bear. ... think wolverine" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 619.—Ursa Minor,
Little Bear.</div>
</div>

<p>Ursa Minor is turned in an opposite
direction and position from the Great Bear,
and the pose makes it easy for us to find
the Pole star, because when we once trace
out the stars of the Great Bear in the real
sky we will see that the two outermost
stars of the four which form its bowl, point to the Pole star.
We can pretend that we have tied a string on the star in
the outside top end of the Big Dipper (<a href="#Fig_616">Figs. 616</a>  and <a href="#Fig_618">618</a> A),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
and that we are stretching that string out from the Dipper star
in a direct line; then we can tie the string on the Pole star in
the end of the Little Bear’s tail, as shown in <a href="#Fig_618">Figs. 618</a>  and <a href="#Fig_620">620</a>,
where the dotted line represents a string.</p>

<p>Trace on cardboard and cut out Ursa Minor, punch holes
through the stars and hold the little fellow up to the light, head
down. The Little Bear, too, is visible shining not far from the
Big Bear during the same months.</p>

<p>There is</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Fairy Tale</b></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 152px;"><a id="Fig_621"></a>
<img src="images/i_453.jpg" width="152" height="232" alt="drawing Cassiopeia around constellation" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 621.—Cassiopeia.</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">about the starry bears. The story tells us that a long time ago
these animals were not bears and did not live among the stars.
The Great Bear was a gentle lady, and the Little Bear her son.
The poor mother and son were turned into bears by the goddess
Juno, and their friend Jupiter had not enough power to disenchant
them and restore to them their human forms. So he did
what he thought was next best; he placed the two bears, mother
and son, up in the sky among the
stars, where they remain to this day.</p>


<p>Fig. 621 is</p>

<p class='center'><b>Cassiopeia</b></p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 622.—Cassiopeia.</div>
</div>
<p class="unindent">In the sky all of her stars are brilliant,
except the one marked K. This is
a shy little twinkler and appears rather
faint at times; but in the Autumn
when you hunt for Cassiopeia, you
will be able to see the star K, if your
eyes are bright. This lady with uplifted
arms is the wife of a king.
Trace her and cut her out, punch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
holes through the centres of the seven stars, then catch hold of
the sweeping train of the queen’s dress and hold her up to the
light, when the pinholes will look like <a href="#Fig_622">Fig. 622</a>,
reminding one of a chair turned upside down,
with its feet toward the queen’s head and its
back down toward her feet. You will be delighted
with this constellation, for it is very
beautiful, and you may find Cassiopeia any night of August,
September, October, November, December, January and February,
as she is always then visible after dark.</p>

<p class="unindent">for he is very fine-looking with his starry mane and a star almost
in his mouth (<a href="#Fig_623">Fig. 623</a>). Trace the lion carefully, name him
Leo, and cut him out;
pierce holes through the

up to the light. The
little girl in <a href="#Fig_617">Fig. 617</a> is
enjoying her Leo very
much. Notice how
earnestly she peers
through the holes, for
she is determined
to
know the
constellation.
When you look through the pinholes of Leo, you
will find that the constellation resembles a sickle,
as in <a href="#Fig_624">Fig. 624</a>. The lion is in plain sight during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>

<p>The little twin brothers,</p>

<p class="unindent">sons of Jupiter; always
sit together up among
the stars. The constellation
is called Gemini
(<a href="#Fig_627">Fig. 627</a>). When stars
are clustered together,
we say the group is a
constellation. All of the
starry people and animals
are only different
constellations. In this
group each boy has a star
on his head, a star on
one knee and a star on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
one foot, which makes six stars. Trace the
twins on cardboard, cut them out together in
one piece and punch a hole through the centre
of each star. Hold the constellation up to the
light, and the group of wee, sparkling stars
seen through the pinholes will resemble <a href="#Fig_628">Fig.
628</a>. Look for the twins during the months
of December, January, February, March,
April and May, and remember you must find

can see him through December, January, February and March.
Orion is one of the most brilliant of constellations. The strenuous
hunter has but one visible foot, the other being hidden by his
pet hare seated in front of it; so we are obliged to make the star,
man with one foot. The fairy tale
says that he was a giant and the
mightiest hunter ever known. There
is a star on each of his shoulders
and one on his
cheek, forming a
triangle; then there
is another star
down on his left
foot and one on his
right knee. Trace
the mighty hunter
and cut him out as
you did the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
constellations. Draw a line from star to star and, after adding
the three stars which form Orion’s belt, pierce holes in all, look
through them (<a href="#Fig_630">Fig. 630</a>) and make friends with the harmless,
starry giant. <a href="#Fig_631">Fig. 631</a> is</p>

growing old. Only a portion of the bull can be seen; other stars
hide the remainder. Taurus
must be greatly dazzled by the
stars, for there is actually one in each of his eyes, the two forming
the ends of the V-shaped group of stars across his face. The
tip of each horn is decked with a glorious star, while on the Bull’s
neck is a cluster of stars called the Pleiades. These stars were
in all seven beautiful sisters, daughters of the giant Atlas; but one
star daughter married a mortal and lost her brightness for doing
so; consequently you can now see but six star sisters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<small>STENCIL PAINTING AND HOW TO
MAKE THE STENCILS</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_458.jpg" width="147" height="212" alt="Y" />
</div>

<div class="drop-cap3">YOU need not be an artist to do the painting
or to make the stencils. It is all easy enough
and, because of the real beauty of the work
and the number of purposes to which it may
be applied, stencilling is growing more and
more popular.</div>

<p>With the stencil you can decorate a
window curtain, portière, table cover, bedspread,
bureau scarf, screen or the walls of your room. You
may even paint the trimmings for a dress if you like; it has been
done.</p>

<div class="caption">A Stencilled Cheese-cloth Curtain.</div>
</div>

<p>Stencilling is effective on almost any material: silk, cotton,
linen and wool. Swiss and cheese-cloth sash curtains are particularly
attractive decorated in this way, and swiss bureau and pin-cushion
covers are very dainty. The drawing on page 427 is of a
white cheese-cloth short sash curtain stencilled in pink and light
apple-green. Both dye and oil paints may be used, but for anything
washable</p>

<p class='center'><b>Dyes</b></p>

<p class="unindent">are the best, inasmuch as they are supposed to be fast colors.
There is an inexpensive dye now on the market that comes in
tubes like oil paint and does not require boiling. This is convenient
to handle, as it is merely necessary to dissolve it in water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Tapestry dyes may also be used but are much more expensive.
Heavy, non-washable material may be stencilled with oil colors.
The color is not used as a paint but as a stain and must be entirely
dissolved in turpentine to make it flow easily. Our first
drawing shows</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Portière</b></p>

<p class="unindent">made of heavy unbleached sheeting stencilled in a Persian pattern
with dull-red, moss-green, yellow and black. Curtains may
also be made of denim, crash, burlap and a number of other
materials. The simplest way to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p class='center'><b>Make Your Stencil</b></p>

<p class="unindent">if you have no especial ideas of your own to carry out, will be
to select a graceful embroidery pattern or one intended for decorative
painting and adapt it to your use. With a little practice this
becomes quite easy. The principal things to remember are that
a good stencil design should be simple, bold and conventional;
the unbroken lines must not be too long nor the spaces to be cut
out too narrow, between the cut-out parts there must be space
wide enough to hold firmly. It is also necessary to break the
lines once in a while with little bridges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;"><a id="Fig_633"></a>
<img src="images/i_462.jpg" width="304" height="119" alt="design" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 633.—Design for outline embroidery.</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose we take the pattern (<a href="#Fig_633">Fig. 633</a>). To make it into</p>

<p class='center'><b>A Design for Stencilling</b></p>

<p class="unindent">we must cut off connections and separate it into many parts, at
the same time keeping the effect of the long curves. Beginning
with the flower we will separate the petals and calyx (A, <a href="#Fig_633">Fig. 633</a>,
and A, <a href="#Fig_634">Fig. 634</a>), and widen the stem (B, <a href="#Fig_633">Fig. 633</a>, and B, <a href="#Fig_634">Fig.
634</a>). Instead of continuing the curve we will break it at C and
D, with two little bridges. This divides the stem into three parts,
and, to give variety and interest to an otherwise monotonous
line, we will widen the first and second parts of the stem at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
lower ends, curving the wide end inward and rounding the end
of the next section to give the idea of its fitting the joint. The
suggestion of the various parts fitting together in stencil designing
is the means of carrying the eye over necessary bridges or
intervening spaces and conveying the impression of continuous
lines. The third section of the stem, where it disappears under
the flower in <a href="#Fig_633">Fig. 633</a>, we will bring to a point in <a href="#Fig_634">Fig. 634</a> to
indicate its vanishing behind the flower. The buds which fill
in the curve of this stem in <a href="#Fig_633">Fig. 633</a> we will leave out altogether,
for they would crowd the design. We will conventionalize the
leaves, dispense with the small stems, broaden the main leaf
stem, separate it from the flower stem and curve each end, one
to fit the base of the end leaf, the other to follow the curve of
the flower stem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;"><a id="Fig_634"></a>
<img src="images/i_463.jpg" width="409" height="170" alt="design" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 634.—This is adapted from an outline embroidery design.</div>
</div>

<p>This furnishes one section of the pattern; the rest is but a
repetition of the same, which is reversed as the curves alternate.</p>

<p>Now for the making of the stencil.</p>

<p>Fig. 635 is a section of the design, actual size, which you can
use immediately, without waiting to develop a design for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Take a piece of smooth white tissue paper, lay it over the
pattern (<a href="#Fig_635">Fig. 635</a>) and, with a very soft lead pencil, trace the pattern
carefully. <a href="#Fig_635">Fig. 635</a> is reversed, especially for tracing. Have
ready a perfectly smooth piece of heavy Manila wrapping paper
seventeen inches long and seven inches wide. With the aid of a
ruler draw two straight lines lengthwise across the paper, the
first line two and a half inches from the top edge of the paper
(E, <a href="#Fig_636">Fig. 636</a>), the next one and three-eighths inches below the
first line (F). One-half of an inch above the first line E draw
another line (G), and one-half of an inch below the line F draw
another line (H).</p>

<p>Lay the tracing, pencilled side down, on the wrapping paper,
with the upper and lower curves of the flower stem just fitting
between the lines G and F (<a href="#Fig_637">Fig. 637</a>). Transfer the tracing to
the wrapping paper by going over the lines of the design with
your soft pencil; then turn the tracing over and bottom edge
up to reverse it and lay it again on the paper, this time with the
curves of the flower stem between the lines E and H, and go over
the lines of the design again with your soft pencil. Once more
reverse the design and bring the curves of the flower stem between
the lines G and F. This last section will finish the
pattern. In reversing the tracing always allow one-quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
an inch space between the tips of the two flower petals I and J
(<a href="#Fig_637">Fig. 637</a>), and the leaf K (<a href="#Fig_637">Fig. 637</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>With a pair of sharp scissors</p>

<p class='center'><b>Cut Out Your Design</b></p>

<p class="unindent">taking great care to keep within the outlines, for a snip beyond
will let in color in the wrong place and spoil your stencil. Remember
you are not to cut the paper <i>away</i> from the design but cut
<i>the design out</i> leaving the surrounding paper intact. This makes
the stencil (<a href="#Fig_638">Fig. 638</a>). When all of the design is cut out place
your stencil flat on a board and give it a coat of white shellac,
then lift it and move to another place on the board to prevent
its sticking. When quite dry turn the stencil over and shellac
the other side. Be sure the edges of the cut-out parts are covered
with shellac as well as the rest of the paper. The shellac makes
the paper waterproof and durable. Do not use the stencil until
it is absolutely dry.</p>

which is the conventionalized
flower, and
transfer it to the centre
of a four-inch square
of the wrapping paper,
or make the flower
smaller if you prefer
to have it the size of
the one in the border.
Cut out the design
and shellac the little
stencil as you did the
larger one (<a href="#Fig_640">Fig. 640</a>).</p>

<p>The closer the
weave of the cloth the easier is the work of stencilling, but the
dye penetrates entirely through thin material, and the effect is
so attractive I will describe the</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 640.—The small stencil.</div>
</div>

<p>One width of cheese-cloth
for each half of the short
Dutch curtains is sufficient
for quite a wide window. If
the curtain is too full much
of the effect of the decoration
is lost.</p>

<p>Select the finest quality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
cheese-cloth and cut it the required length. Hem the bottom
edge and lay the curtain, right side up, smoothly on a lap-board
with the hem at the top. Place your stencil on the curtain so
that the design will be about one inch and a half from the hem.
Slide a new piece of blotter paper under the curtain to absorb
the extra moisture, then tack the stencil down with rather small
pins. Drive a pin in the centre of each flower, at the point of
each petal and at the point of each leaf, between the petals and
between the leaves, also in every bridge and along the edges of
the design wherever the paper is inclined to lift (<a href="#Fig_641">Fig. 641</a>). In
short, your endeavor must be to keep the stencil perfectly flat
on the cloth so that the dye will not penetrate beyond the openings
and blur the outlines.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 641.—Tack the stencil down with pins.</div>
</div>

<p>Before tacking the stencil in place</p>

<p class='center'><b>Make Your Dye Ready</b></p>

<p class="unindent">Buy a tube of olive green dye, one of yellow and one of cardinal
red. Squeeze about a teaspoonful of dye into a teacup, add
two tablespoonfuls of boiling water, stir until dissolved, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
add enough boiling water to give the desired shade. You can
test the depth of color by dipping bits of white cloth in the dye.
Each dye must be in a separate cup and a little yellow should
be added to the green after it is dissolved, but before it is diluted
with the extra water. Have ready</p>

<p class='center'><b>Two Stiff Bristle Brushes,</b></p>

<p class="unindent">such as are used for oil painting, and a piece of old white muslin.
With your stencil in place, take the board on your lap, set the
dye on a stand at your side and lay the old muslin folded on the
board above your curtain. Dip a brush in the dye and rub it
on the muslin to remove some of the moisture, for a brush too
wet will cause the dye to spread and spoil the outline of the
design.</p>

<p>Beginning at the left hand of your stencil, scrub the cheese-cloth
in the openings of the design until it becomes the right
shade and the dye sinks entirely through the cloth. The flowers
must be pink and the leaves green, but you can make the flowers
darker at the centre if you wish by applying more color. Use
separate brushes for the green and red dye. Hold the brush
firmly and in an upright position.</p>

it flat on the board and paint it with the dye, using your bristle
paint brush for the purpose. When the cloth is dry cut it into
pieces four inches long. Dye a number of strands of white
linen floss, or use green linen or silk floss for tying the tassels.</p>

<p>Fold one piece of the dyed cheese-cloth crosswise through the
centre and crease it (<a href="#Fig_642">Fig. 642</a>). Thread a coarse needle with a
strand of the floss and run it through the crease, leaving several
inches of the floss at each end (<a href="#Fig_643">Fig.
643</a>). Draw the material into gathers
and tie securely (<a href="#Fig_644">Fig. 644</a>). Then
bring the two ends together. Make a loop of the floss about one
inch long (<a href="#Fig_645">Fig. 645</a>), and fasten by taking one or two stitches in
the gathers. Open the fold, bring the ends of the floss on the
underside of the tassel, tie close to the gathers and cut off the ends.
Run another gathering thread across each half of the tassel, half
an inch below the gathers at the top (<a href="#Fig_646">Fig. 646</a>). Draw the
thread tight, wrap it around several times to form the neck
(<a href="#Fig_647">Fig. 647</a>), and fasten with several stitches. Cut the floss close
to the wrapping and with the scissors trim off the bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>

inches apart on the bottom edge of the curtains, as shown
in illustration. When the curtains are</p>

<p class='center'><b>To be Laundered</b></p>

<p class="unindent">soak them for an hour or more in a strong solution of salt and
water, then wash carefully in the suds of a pure white soap and
rinse thoroughly. Do not rub the soap on the material, and
before putting the curtain in water shake and brush out all loose
dust. Dry in the shade.</p>

<p>Mr. Beard’s book tells the active, inventive, and practical American boy
the things he really wants to know; the thousand things he wants to do, and
the ten thousand ways in which he can do them, with the helps and ingenious
contrivances which every boy can either procure or make. The author
divides the book among the sports of the four seasons; and he has made an
almost exhaustive collection of the
cleverest modern devices, besides
himself inventing an immense number
of capital and practical ideas.</p>

<p>“It is an excellent publication, and is heartily recommended to parents.”—<i>The
Brooklyn Eagle.</i></p>

the year; it is practical, and it is well illustrated.”—<i>The New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“It tells boys how to make all kinds of things—boats, traps, toys, puzzles, aquariums,
fishing tackle; how to tie knots, splice ropes, to make bird calls, sleds, blow guns, balloons;
how to rear wild birds, to train dogs, and do the thousand and one things that boys take delight

<p>“It is one of the completest things of the kind ever written, and with it one can hardly
conceive how a boy could be without pleasant and profitable amusement at any time. It
treats of directions for every season of the year, in and out of doors, and on land and water.
One of the best things about it is that it furnishes employment for a boy’s ingenuity and
mechanical skill. It seems as if this book must be destined to an immense popularity.”—<i>The
